'' norton 's 'solar queen ' stories are told from the viewpoint of dane thorson , an apprentice-cargo master who is introduced in `` sargasso of space , '' the first 'solar queen ' novel , as a `` lanky , very young man in an ill-fitting trader 's tunic . '' most of this author 's heroes and heroines are young , uncertain of themselves , shy , with a tendency to trip over their own enthusiasms and load themselves up with guilt at the slightest opportunity . they are very likeable and their adventures are narrated in remarkably lean prose with just the right touch of description . after ten years of schooling , orphan dane thorson is assigned via a computer analysis of his psychological profile -- not to a safe berth on a sleek company-run starship that his classmates were vying for -- but to a battered tramp of a free trader . to say that the 'solar queen ' `` lacked a great many refinements and luxurious fittings which the company ships boasted '' was an understatement . but she was a tightly-run ship and what she lacked in refinement , she made up for in adventure . dane soon settles in under cargo master van rycke and learns `` to his dismay what large gaps unfortunately existed in his training . '' sometimes i just want to give dane a big hug . `` plague ship '' takes the crew of the 'solar queen ' to sargol , where the enigmatic feline natives seem very reluctant to trade away their fabulous scented gemstones . when dane thorson discovers an herb that the salariki are willing to swap for their gems , he fears that his eagerness to make a trade breakthrough might have poisoned a native child . that becomes the least of his worries when the 'solar queen ' blasts off from sargol with invisible , undetectable stowaways that would brand the free traders anathema to all inhabited worlds . in space , the more senior members of the 'solar queen 's ' crew succumb to a strange plague that resembles sleeping sickness . dane and his fellow-apprentices , with the assistance of captain jellico 's hoobat ( a sort of blue parrot-lizard , or at least that 's how i 've always pictured it ) discover the source of the plague : venomous hitch-hikers from sargol . `` it walked erect on two threads of legs ... a bulging abdomen sheathed in the horny substance of a beetle 's shell ended in a sharp point . '' it was only about a foot-and-a-half high and could change color like a chameleon . the hoobat kills and eats the first creature , and then the hunt is on for others of its kind . even with the source of the sleeping sickness discovered , the 'solar queen 's ' young apprentices must still convince the rest of the galaxy that they are not a plague ship -- and therefore eligible to be destroyed on sight without warning . the 'solar queen ' novels are prime representatives of norton 's lean action-packed brand of story-telling ( at least the ones she solo-authored . ) if you have n't read them since you were a teen-ager , i urge you to try them again . for a few pleasant hours , you will be immersed in the adventures of a likeable , feisty band of free traders on exotic , carefully-drawn alien worlds ."}, {"num": 1192, "context": "donna while i have just begun to enjoy this tremendous work that came highly recommended to me , i am already somewhat disappointed in the limited , male-oriented , patriarchal interpretation of some indisputably feminine symbols like the minoan great mother goddess referenced and pictured under the entry , axe on page 16 . described as a 'phallic ' representation of her 'parthenogenetic fertility , ' and as a , 'solar emblem of the 'sky gods , ' and later as an , 'emblem of saint john the babtist , ' this is clearly a female iconic goddess figure holding a double-sided labrys ( axe ) in each upraised arm . the labrys is a feminine symbol associated with the female amazons that were priestesses of artemis , the moon goddess . during their time , lunar energies were associated with the goddess , and feminine power , not masculine , phallic , sky-gods ."}], "laszlo": [{"num": 1160, "context": "i 've give it no stars if i could certainly it is not to my dismay that this will be the author 's last edition . her information is all right in many ways , but useless in most . if you want drug store quality cosmetics , you can find useful ones , some very good ones . if you want very good quality cosmetics , more often you will pay for the increased quality . ms. begoun says in the intro to this ( hopefully ) final edition , that she was hired by a mall in silver spring years ago . since i grew up in the silver spring area and still live nearby , i 'd love to know what mall she 's referring to . years ago there were no malls in silver spring . a few shopping centers , but no malls . she says she had acne and saw that toners did n't close pores , etc . she 's right in many ways , but she 's way off in so many other ways her book is a mish-mash of misinformation mixed in with some basic common sense that anyone can figure out on her own . if you want the very best cosmetics , you will have to patronize high-end stores like nordstrom , saks fifth avenue , neiman marcus , etc . the professionals there will help you find what is best for your skin . it may take time , but all depends on what you want . ms. begoun criticizes some very fine lines of cosmetics . maybe they do n't work for her . when i look through her book , it may be cleverly written , but she does n't really know what she 's talking about . i had `` bad skin '' until i began using the erno laszlo line . i had clogged pores , pimples , dry , scaly patches . after a few months of using laszlo and continuing to now , people i do n't even know comment on how clear and pretty my complexion is . strangers do n't comment on someone 's skin for nothing . when i see ms. begoun 's book , i always turn to the section where she rips the erno laszlo line of cosmetics . this edition , she omits what she has written in the past , that laszlo customers are extremely loyal and swear by the product . there is a reason laszlo customers are loyal . it works better than any other line out there if you want your skin to look excellent throughout your life . i have used erno laszlo for almost 32 years and no one ever believes that i am 53 years old . of course i do n't look 20 ! but my skin is smooth , the occasional dark `` age spot '' that appears fades within a few weeks of using laszlo 's wonderful `` no . 3-9 '' . my husband is 47 , looks younger than 47 , and still everyone thinks he is older than me . my lipline is smooth , lipstick has no vertical lines to bleed into when i wear lipstick , which is daily . ms. begoun in this edition of the book says that erno laszlo could not have known about exfoliation or the dangers of rinsing with hot , hot water ( part of his system requires 30 rinses of hot water twice a day ) , but that rinsing does exfoliate and i have no tiny spider veins on my face that she claims hot water can cause . my cheeks are smooth and while gravity is taking its toll ( laszlo works , but gravity is a very powerful force and i do n't expect to look 40 when i 'm 70 ! ) she rips other up-scale cosmetic lines but i think that 's because she has a conflict of interest . is she selling her own products ?

after all , we know that the israelis , good or bad , do want peace and do need peace . they spent the past several decades building up a nation . and they want to keep it . that is one reason they need peace . and that is also a reason why it is easy to tempt them with bogus offers of peace , just like tempting a fish with bait on a hook . but just as fish need food , israelis need peace . huband did n't say that . but we know that israelis really do want peace . we know that if israelis are innocent victims , they want peace . we know that if israelis are guilty thieves , they still want peace , just to keep their illicit gains . what does it mean for huband to imply that israelis do not really want ( or do not really appear to want ) peace ? well such a claim is surely a falsehood . but more than that , it is a taunt . after all , suppose a bully decides to beat you up . and suppose that bully claims you want to fight ! obviously , you may well prefer to be left alone to being beaten up . what the bully is saying is a taunt . it 's more than a mere falsehood . it is a blatant way for bullies to tease their victims . that means that huband 's book is taunting israelis . that 's not a very good thing for a journalist to do . it goes beyond telling mere falsehoods . huband also implies that jews have taken arab land , and admit to it . and that they have taken an arab country ! i wonder which one ? and i also wonder if buying land at high prices constitutes `` taking '' it . after all , we humans are living on the same planet as the one that existed in 1805 . not one human who was alive in 1805 is alive today . have we all stolen the planet from them ? of course not . we have bought it and inherited it . there has been some theft , but that is no reason to invalidate the right of all humans to live on this planet today . huband implies that the arabs ought to have a greater right to steal jewish land than the jews do to own the land they bought at high prices . that 's bad journalism too . and there 's more . the author calls former israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu an `` extremist . '' now , i might understand making some snide remark about former prime minister yitzhak shamir , who after all was a former leader of the stern gang . one might even do the same for former prime minister menachim begin , who was a former leader of the irgun . but netanyahu ? once again , this is poor journalism . and by the way , you might want to see how often the author calls any arabs `` extremists . '' it is true that antisemitic propaganda and incitement in the arab world has reminded many israelis of similar propaganda and incitement in germany in the 1930s . and that has resulted in some analogies being made between arab antisemitism today and german antisemitism before and during world war two . huband makes fun of such analogies . i think he should have taken them seriously . more bad journalism . the author does take benjamin beit-hallahmi seriously , though . huband quotes him to explain that the arabs are `` innocent bystanders , '' and that the jews are visiting revenge on the arabs for european antisemitism ! this is total nonsense , of course . more bad journalism . now , does a `` one-state '' solution to the arab-israeli conflict make sense ? maybe so . israel exists in order to protect jewish rights and to provide a refuge for jews . it exists to provide a state where jews will speak hebrew natively , attend hebrew schools universities , have hebrew traditions , and so forth . it can do all that in a state which has a large non-jewish population . and israel , even with ten thousand square miles , would be rather small for a state which houses over five million jews . if jewish rights to life , liberty , property , and immigration are protected , a one-state solution may be best . besides , while many people say that another arab state is needed as well , i see no real need for one except as a mechanism to attack or destroy israel . the author agrees that a one-state solution is best . and i think he even acknowledges that israel is part of the middle east . but it seems to me that his reason for wanting a one-state solution is to demolish jewish rights rather than support them . and getting rid of human rights would be bad for everyone in the region . this book is a good one to avoid"}], "arnhart": [{"num": 1325, "context": "disingenuous argument larry arnhart is a serious , perceptive ethical philosopher whose works deserve praise ( and to be read ) , but this book is a failure . the arguments are weak and will certainly fail to convince most `` conservatives '' to embrace darwinian evolutionary theory . evolutionary biology is scientifically correct , which is the main reason it must be accepted by anyone , whatever their political philosophy ( arnhart does not stress this ) . however , darwinian biology can be either used or ignored in making political arguments , so i will rephrase the issue as : are there good arguments flowing from evolutionary biology for conservative political philosophy ? we must note that at least in the usa , there are two quite different branches of conservativism , one espousing religious fundamentalism and the other classical economic liberalism . they have almost nothing in common intellectually and are simply politically linked by historical events . arnhart does not stress this point . arnhart 's arguments directed towards religious conservatism can be summarized as : ( a ) evolutionary biology is compatible with belief in god ; ( b ) evolutionary biology recognizes and reinforces the notion that religious belief is a universal element of human nature ; and ( c ) a strong adherence to family values is part of human nature . i agree with these statements , but arnhart never addresses the burning issues , which include abortion , homosexuality , gay marriage , and state-religion separation . he does deal with intelligent design , which he rejects as a scientific theory . this is in part why i call his book `` disingenuous : '' he simply avoids the hard topics . turning to classical liberalism , arnhart says that darwinian evolution supports a burkean political philosophy . i think this is a plausible argument , although arnhart avoids all the hard questions by choosing as the alternative political philosophy an absurd caricature of the leftist alternative that is more or less 19th century utopianism . societies grow organically , arnhart says , and can not be socially engineered using the principles of reason alone . of course this is correct , but this is accepted by all relevant political philosophers today ( except peter singer and his bizarre ilk ) . what about the proper extent of government , the treatment of poverty , the environment , and foreign relations ?

' i suppose if one considers logic 101 tinged with the usual fundamentalist `defender of the faith ' rhetoric and aura ( which hovers over every page ) , then this could be called `scholarly . ' the big problem i found is that even when groothuis offers defensible criticisms , his alternatives end up being just as problematic as the positions he criticizes . for all his advocacy for a correspondence theory of truth , his tone betrays a penchant for certainty and formal coherence . he falls into the problem of the relation between thought and `reality , ' representation to presentation , the role of language , and so forth . no doubt god comes to save the day with all these problems , yet on the very justificatory terms groothuis advocates for , god escapes the measure of correspondence and becomes its condition of possibility . in other words , god becomes a structural metaphysical function which `saves ' groothuis 's truth from the skeptic . the problem , however , is that groothuis wants truth to be absolute , universal , and accessible to all , yet he is dependent on a moment ( i.e . faith ) which , by definition , retains a trace of contingency or `objective ' undecidability . groothuis 's more ethical concerns are where i am more sympathetic , but again , here his polemics and non-reading of the people he criticizes drowned out whatever constructive points he offers . groothuis practices the same type of irresponsible reflection that some of the `pomo ' evangelical 's do : uncriticality . here , philosophy and reflection - whether modern or postmodern - becomes a means to simply confirm and justify a complacent status quo , rather than challenging and transforming the status quo . the challenge presented in this book is for a nostalgic return to the good old days of christendom . jesus did not come to `save ' our metaphysical systems , but to redeem us and this world . that redemption is not contingent upon accurate representations as groothuis seems to think . it is madness to the greek ( i.e . the logician ) and a stumbling block to the legalist ( i.e . moralistic hypocrites ) . the task is not to make the faith less crazy or more socially repressive . as james tells us , the measure of `true ' faith - and here i will grant a type of reference - is that we `attend to the widow and orphan .

'' ( 153 ) perhaps it 's because i 'm a mountain-climber myself , but i found juss and brandoch daha 's assault on koshtra pivrarcha to be the most memorable chapter in a book built out of unforgettable chapters . in real life no two mountain ranges are alike , yet most fantasy authors write only staid standard-issue descriptions when they make mountains . eddison understood that for us to see the glaciers , feel the biting cold winds , and experience the exhilaration of reaching the summit with the heroes , he needs to give his mountains some real personality . these samples , of course , only scratch the surface of eddison 's brilliant mix of visceral detail and towering metaphor ; he maintains this level , never flagging , for all two hundred thousand words . but of course `` the worm ouroboros '' could hardly have claimed such a lofty space in the pantheon of imaginative fiction without a plot and character worthy of this lavish writing . on one side king gorice xii of witchland sends his warriors out to crush all opposition and subjugate the entire world to his will . opposing him are the adventure-loving lords of demonland , lead by the magnificent lord juss and his family . the ensuing conflict will rage on land and sea , across continents and mountain ranges . and without any doubt eddison crafts his dialogue with the same mastery he displays in his narration : `` la fireez , '' said juss , `` we weigh not so lightly our obligation unto thee . yet must i hold my course ; having sworn a strong oath that i would turn aside neither to the right nor to the left until i had delivered my dear brother goldry out of bondage . so sware i or ever went that ill journey to carce and was closed in prison fast and by thee delivered . nor shall blame of friends nor wrongful misprison nor any power that is shake me in this determination . but when that is done , no rest remaineth unto us till we win back for thee thy rightful realm of pixyland , and many good things besides to be a token of our love . '' said the prince , `` thou doest right . if thou didst other thou'dst have my blame . '' `` and mine thereto , '' said gaslark . `` do not i grieve , think'st thou , to see the princess armelline , my sweet young cousin , grow every day more wan o ' the cheek and pale ? and all for sorrow and teen for her own true love , the lord goldry bluszco . and she so carefully brought up by her mother as nothing was too dear or hard to be bought to pass for her desire , thinking that a creature so noble and perfect could not be trained up too delicately . i deem to-day better than to-morrow , and to-morrow better than his morrow , to set sail for wide-fronted impland .

pages , processing mail , etc . are a huge market , but that linnux owns a big percentage of that market . consequently microsoft came up with the .net strategy . .net is a bunch of subroutines ( if you will ) that are written to provides all kinds of utility to programmers . you write your applications using propriatary programming languages such as c # and j # that use the .net library and consequently have to run on microsoft operating systems . in the office environment , packages such as openoffice have gotten to be pretty good , are basically microsoft compatible so you do n't have a re-training problem , and are free . i do n't know how much success openoffice has had , but it appears to be enough to attract microsoft 's attention . enter vsto . vsto adds customization and productivity to microsoft office applications through 'links ' that tie office to the .net framework . so to use vsto first you must have and load the .net framework , then you must load visual studio.net - in that order -- then install visual studio 2005 tools for office . all of this is clearly explained by mr. bruney in this book , who then goes on to do an excellent job of explaing how

1973 . `` streamers '' looks at a group of army soldiers who are facing the possibility of being sent to vietnam while the war is going on . rabe focuses on a group of three roommates , all junior soldiers . as these troops talk and argue together with the other soldiers in the play , rabe shows how tensions within the military can create fracture lines along many axes of difference : race , sexual orientation , educational background , rank . early on in the play rabe introduces the theme of homosexuality in the army ; this theme plays a significant role as the story unfolds . also explored is the relationship between younger troops and experienced combat veterans . `` streamers '' is a play that may seem a deceptively straightforward slice of military life , but i found it to be a dense and complex text , rich in irony , that rewards careful reading . it 's a powerful play that effectively presents a group of military personnel as a microcosmic world of tension , lust , anxiety , anger , and violence . particularly piercing is rabe 's look at the intersection of verbal `` violence '' and physical violence . i found `` the orphan '' far less interesting than its companion piece . in it rabe melds ancient greek lore with late-20th century american concerns . although the play has some strong moments , overall i felt it lacked effectiveness . i felt that rabe

relief to know that this treasure chest of a book is around to keep their memories alive . the author got the idea for it in 1961 when he read that ty cobb had died . realizing that many of cobb 's contemporaries would soon suffer the same fate , he set out to meet as many of them as he could and record -- literally with a tape recorder -- their stories for posterity . twenty six of them are recounted here . some of these guys are hall-of-famers , some of them not even close , but all of them -- every single one -- had a load of interesting tidbits to share . baseball was a different game back then . america was a different place . the first great thing about the book is that you get at least several takes on the great ballplayers . one of the fellows , for example , playing detroit , talked about being a little nervous about cobb , whom they had all heard would sharpen his spikes . a detroit player , however , mentioned that cobb never sharpened his spikes . not that they did n't discourage the other team from thinking so . walter johnson had an arm like a bullwhip , but he was a nice enough guy and a friend of sam crawford . late in the game , if his team was ahead by enough runs , he 'd toss a meatball in to crawford and let him belt it . he never did that for cobb , though , who he hated . cobb could never figure out why crawford was able to hit him . honus wagner is recalled by many as the best of all of them , with great quickness , great hitting and great fielding . a couple of the fellows recall that you could usually count on bits of gravel to be flung at you along with the ball he had just scooped up . tommy leach described him as the best fielding third-baseman , shortstop , first-baseman and outfielder in the league -- he played all of them -- and since he won the batting title eight times between 1900 and 1911 you could n't really argue that he was n't the best hitter in the league , either . for some odd reason , there are n't that many memorable gems about the great babe ruth , although there are at least a few . harry hooper ( a guy i 'd never heard of and a hall-of-famer ) remembers ruth in the first year he came up with boston as a , `` big , overgrown , green pea .

'' the author points out that at the time of the mutiny on the whaleship `` sharon , '' people who were not on board the ship assumed that the south sea islanders who killed captain howes norris did so because they were `` cannibals '' and `` heathens . '' the people who had direct knowledge of the events preceding the mutiny did nothing to dispel this notion- to do so would have raised questions concerning their own active or passive complicity in norris 's actions and could have damaged the careers of some highly ambitious ships ' officers . it turns out that captain norris had , over a long period of time , systematically beaten and abused an 18 year old crew member ( and apparent fugitive slave ) named george babcock . a combination of floggings and backbreaking labor finally resulted in the death of babcock . worse still , it appears that norris knew , way before the final denouement , that his actions would result in babcock 's death . it was the result he was looking for . druett speculates on the motivation ( s ) : racism , anger/fear ( norris had had trouble keeping control over his crew on a prior voyage on a different ship ) , frustration ( the `` sharon '' was having very bad luck finding and catching whales ) , etc . of course , harsh discipline was nothing unusual on board ships at the time . but norris seems to have been especially brutal , even by 19th century standards . babcock at one point tried to get help from his fellow crewmembers , as he feared for his life . his mates did try to protect him , before finally yielding to the authority of the captain and his officers . why did the officers support the captain ? we have to remember that a captain was sovereign of his ship . going against his wishes could result in being branded a mutineer ... not exactly good for your career . in any event , it appears that the south sea islanders who killed captain norris were either similarly abused or felt that , given enough time , they would suffer the same fate as babcock . `` in the wake of madness '' works as both an adventure story- as mrs. druett describes the recapture of the `` sharon '' by her crew- and as something broader- as we learn a bit about the day-to-day operation of a whaling ship and of the cultural dynamics that came into play when new england whalers met pacific islanders . stopping off at the islands was a bit like playing `` russian roulette . '' on some islands , the natives were very friendly and would provide women and food for trade goods ( although they did have a propensity for stealing anything made of iron that was n't nailed down ) . on other islands you could run into cannibals or natives who would murder the crew and steal the ship . not infrequently , some crewmembers who felt misused would jump-ship at some friendly port-of-call and `` go native '' or try to `` sign-on '' with another whaling ship with a more easy-going captain . we also learn a little about life back home on martha 's vineyard . the book seems a bit abrupt and frantically paced , with mrs. druett attempting to juggle all this in only 230 pages . still , this is a generally well-written , interesting book , and worth your time"}], "qualia": [{"num": 791, "context": "the mystery of the zombie hunch as the concept of the modular structure of the brain emerged , objections to the idea took the form of `` well , if my brain 's made up of computers , somebody in there has to be in charge . it had better be me ! '' this comment , paraphrased from philosopher jerry fodor , typifies what daniel dennett has been contending with for many years . although the `` cartesian theatre '' notion , that the body was one aspect of our being and the mind another - `` dualism '' - has supposedly been supplanted , it has not lost its hold on our view of consciousness . we continue to insist , in some form or other , that `` somebody , and it better be me '' is inside our minds looking out at the world . although we ca n't find that `` self '' in there , we have a hunch it 's there . when dennett wrote `` consciousness explained '' in 1991 , it seemed the `` homunculus '' representing our `` self '' had been laid to rest . this excellent collection of essays and lectures , is an update on that earlier work . as lectures , they have a conversational tone , yet impart many deep insights . addressing consciousness through four major themes , dennett shows us the project of eradicating `` dualism '' remains incomplete . until that view of `` self '' is discarded , our understanding of consciousness will remain misleading . the first theme he addresses is the `` zombie '' . philosophers have posed the idea that a duplicate person , identical to you in every way but one , is logically possible . the person would act as you act , talk as you do , have the same preferences and distastes . but it would not be conscious . this proposal presumes that something in you could be identified that is lacking in the zombie . for most of us , who still feel our `` self '' remains somehow separate within us , the logic seems reasonable . dennett carefully examines the implications of the proposal , and dismisses it as modernised dualism . if a region of the brain holds the key to `` self '' it remains out of sight and undetectable . perhaps the most challenging segment of the book deals with `` heterophenomonology '' . this tongue-twisting phrase refers to the methods used in cognitive science . because consciousness is `` often celebrated as a mystery beyond science '' dennett challenges researchers to take a step back from commonly accepted techniques . become a `` martian '' cognitive scientist to broaden the scope of the work . one facet of this approach relies on understanding what `` folk psychology '' is , then building from there . we prefer to believe that what we believe is entirely private and unaccessible . heterophenomonolgy , he contends , will expose aspects of our consciousness we view as a `` mystery '' . one of those `` mysteries '' has been wrapped in the idea of `` qualia '' . probably one of the poorest concepts in philosophy , `` qualia '' are things said to possess `` intrinsic qualities '' . when you carefully examine those `` intrinsic '' properties , they begin to fade and vanish . if `` qualia '' is in an object we see , such as colour , how can it change without our noticing ? tests of `` change blindness '' indicate we can miss much concerning `` qualia '' . even the philosophic community , dennett notes , can not agree on a definition of `` qualia '' . yet , like the homunculus in the mind viewing the world , it steadfastly remains in use . the author examines this idea further in relating the story of `` mary '' , the colour-deprived scientist . in `` consciousness explained '' , dennett proposed the multiple drafts model of consciousness and cognition . in this collection , he enhances the original concept . with no centre in the brain , consciousness necessarily must be a distributed process . the progress of imaging and other technologies have expanded our view of the brain 's functions . dennett argues that the brain is `` fame '' not `` television '' . the process is one of competition for dominance , no matter how fleeting . the mind is not a `` top-down '' or `` bottom-up '' process , but a `` sideways '' one . ideas , experiences and other informational bits jostle for `` clout '' . it 's not easy to shed the idea of a special `` self '' in your mind , but all that 's going on in there is still you . as usual , dennett has challenged successfully the `` established '' views of consciousness . clearly , he argues , consciousness is neither an arcane `` mystery '' nor beyond serious and definitive investigation . the mind-set erecting barricades using the bricks of `` qualia '' and the mortar of the `` cartesian theatre '' can , and must be , overcome for serious investigation to proceed . delicacy and care must be employed , but the prize is understanding .

( sorry , but sweetbreads , halves of calf heads , and brains were not appetizing subjects . ) also , i gave up finishing the book . i started to read `` an alphabet for gourmets '' , the last section , but got as far as `` d '' and could n't force myself to read through the rest of the alphabet . it seems to me by the time in her life when she wrote this section she had become rather cynical and bitter , to the extent that everything she wrote sounded condescending . this section was such a let-down , a depressant to me after coming off the high of `` the gastronomical me '' . although i exaggerate , she seemed to repeatedly state something to the effect that she preferred to dine alone on crackers and milk rather than face gourmet meals with uncultivated people ( with untrained palettes ) who were unsavvy as to the proper way food should be eaten in the first place and incapable of appreciating what they shoved in their faces in the second . anyway , other readers may disagree with me , but this last section lacks the consistency , and more important , the vibrancy and pep of her flowing , off-the-wall style that grows on you in the other sections . although i was a little disheartened at the end , her brilliance that shone through in the other sections more than outweighed the few negatives . i can recommend this book to everyone , especially to people who are interested in food as a literary subject in its own right instead of something that we simply cook and eat . of course , foodies and cooks alike should appreciate it . and though it does have some very good recipes as added bonuses , this should not be considered a cookbook ; instead , this book 's function is to serve up delicious tidbits for our minds and imaginations to savor and enjoy ."},

find out that this is basically unnecessary if they can successfully negotiate the behaviors of the employees so that it better serves the businesses ' need , not just the narcassist needs of the

help my business owner/manager successfully navigate a similar problem . it should be required reading for all entry level employees ( along with another favorite of mine `` the rules of work and the rules of management '' . because employees step out of the academic world usually and then enter the business world , there are no hard fast rules , even if you attended an executive business university to guide you in how to manage yourself in the environment , or were raised with the self-disclipine required to be successful in the business world . these tools of knowledge are like boot-camp for entering the business world . hr folks suffer in silence trying to help these people and because its really up to them to get the business procedures and policies of the company when told to them , this book helps communicate to them what they do n't get or what businesses usually do n't think they need to communicate during the hiring process because any other behavior is cause for disciplinary action . the behaviors described in this book suit all types of industries and organizations . dr. goulston explains it so brilliantly and seamlessly , it 's clear what our choices should be if we still exhibit the same behaviors after one is assigned to reading it because there is a chapter within the book about how the guilt of these descision effects us about the tough-love we should make if they do n't get it . for those rare few that your organization seeks to help and no end to the frustruation or how to communicate it to those that create it , this book is a treasure for growth and career development within the business environment , no matter what the employee 's behavior is . i believe that if applied the insights within this book can help prevent these behaviors from developing or derail if read early in one 's own career . even if hr people read it and share the knowledge with their owner/managers , it will tune us and our business owners and

gary b. nash 's purpose for the book is , `` to capture the revolutionary involvement of all the component parts of some three million wildly varying people living east of the mississippi river . '' ( nash , xxviii ) nash bemoans how the `` great men '' still `` dominate the master narrative [ of the american revolution , ] '' ( nash , xv ) and that we are struck with `` historical amnesia , '' ( nash , xvi ) because we forgot the stories of those outside of the `` great men '' clique . he states that we can not capture the essence of the revolution without paying close attention to the experiences of the many groups that made up colonial society . these groups not only include the poor farmers , artisans , and other laborers , but also of women , blacks ( both free and slave ) , and of the amerindian population . nash illustrated the problems and plights of the lower order through their myriad of stories . to illustrate the importance of the lower classes of white society , he showed the importance of these individuals in their role as revolutionaries , which include their participation in riots against the various taxes implemented by the parliament . he also shows the tensions between the seaboard inhabitants and their piedmont antithesis to the west which , in his estimation , helped to spur change all along the way . in the case of the inhabitants of what would become vermont , he illuminated their fight against the landowners located primarily in new york city . led by ethan allen , the `` green mountain boys , '' as they would become known as , fought to keep the land that they cultivated with their own hands - against the wishes and land deeds that the new york city landowners had for their property . ( nash , 110 - 114 ) he also showed how the piedmont inhabitants of the carolinas had to struggle for their rights to live life as they saw fit as well . ( nash , 73 - 79 ) in the case of the `` green mountain boys , '' their struggle proved to be more successful than the struggle of the carolina piedmont , whose insurrection was brutally suppressed by then colonial governor of north carolina , william tryon . nash also shows how this sector of the population became mobilized politically during the course of the revolution . in nash 's estimation , these people were spurred on by the rhetoric of equality in society , as championed by the founding fathers in the countless tracts and pamphlets that were produced during the revolutionary war era . in pennsylvania , the 1776 state constitution was heralded by nash as a true revolutionary document because of its unicameral legislature , its weak executive , and its attempt to limit an amassing of wealth within the state . he also praised the fact that artisans and lower sorts also played such a vital role in the forming of the new state constitution . ( nash , 271 - 286 ) in states where the constitution did adhere to these premises , nash equated it with a betrayal of the will of the people , as evident by the problems massachusetts had in ratifying their state constitution because of its more conservative outlook . ( nash , 302 - 304 ) the talk of freedom and equality also spread , according to nash , to the black population in the american colonies . these ideals not only spread to the free black portion of the population , but also to the thousands of enslaved blacks throughout the land . this spread of ideas to the black population , particularly the enslaved portion , troubled white leaders , according to nash ( nash , 59 ) what was more troubling to the white slave owners was their perception that slave restlessness and even revolt was on the rise . ( nash , 37 - 39 ) what else was truly troubling to many slave holders was that the british actively recruited the slaves to fight against their masters - and all other rebels to the british crown . ( nash , 157 - 164 ) nash contributed much of the awareness of the enslaved to their plight the rise rising literature of freedom that the founding fathers were disseminating across the land . nash believes that this rhetoric , and its implications , were inescapable to the slaves . ( nash , 64 ) he also showed us the aftermath of the revolution for those slaves who sided with the british ; they were transported off either to nova scotia or to the caribbean islands where they were subjected to an even harsher form of slavery than on the mainland . ( nash , 426 - 427 ) women also were praised in this work , as nash pointed out how crucial this sector of the population was throughout the course of the conflict . first , women were important to execute the boycotts that were prevalent in the preceding years of the revolution . nash argued that without their co-operation in the boycotts , the measures would not have proved effective . this is because women had a great deal of involvement in the running of the household and much of the purchasing power was in their hands . if they did not adhere to the boycotts , the measure would have failed , in nash 's estimation . ( nash , 141 - 144 ) nash also illustrated how the women of the revolution became active during the war , specifically in response to rising prices for necessities . nash showed us the response of many women in the boston area to thomas boylston , a merchant whose prices on goods rose as the war progressed . in response to these rising prices , women marched on boylston 's shop , and the shops of other merchants throughout the colonies , to procure the basic necessities for their families at what they deemed equitable prices . ( nash , 232 - 235 ) the plight of the american indians was also great as land speculators and land hungry colonists swarmed over the appalachian mountain range to claim and settle upon lands that were seen as belonging to various indian nations . nash showed us how the natives resisted this encroachment upon their lands through a myriad of tactics , from essentially engaging in bushwhacking warfare with the colonists who encroached upon their lands , ( nash , 253 - 255 ) to the fact that many indian nations chose to align themselves with the british in their cause to suppress the rebellion . ( nash , 151 - 157 ) what was more alarming to nash is the colonists ' `` genocidal '' policies towards the native population . ( nash , 377 - 381 ) although it may not seem like it , there is an underlying premise to nash 's illustrations in the struggles of all of the aforementioned groups during the american revolution . that premise with nash , at first alluded to , and then by the end of the book , states bluntly is class warfare . there is , however , a very real problem in this marxist outlook on american society during the era of the revolution , specifically that the colonists did not view the class structure in the same light that we do today , or even as class was viewed in when karl marx wrote his tracts on such matters . as gordon wood pointed out in his work , the radicalism of the american revolution , `` the social distinctions and economic deprivations that we today think of as the consequence of class divisions , business exploitation , or various isms - capitalism , racism , etc . - were in the eighteenth century usually thought to be caused by the abuses of government . '' ( wood , 5 ) wood also pointed out that there were complexities and variations to american society , which fell along `` local , regional , sectional , ethnic and class differences . '' these complexities made , `` any generalization about americans as a whole , '' quite difficult . ( wood , 6 ) wood further illuminated the difficulties of following such a class distinction as nash proposed in his work . wood stated in his review on nash 's work in the `` new republic online '' : nash 's evidence for popular resistance to all this class exploitation is the incidents of rural rioting and urban mobbing that took place in the decade or so leading up to the revolution . this mobbing and rioting is exceedingly familiar to historians , who have produced a literature about it . unfortunately , these phenomena do not support nash 's argument . not only did the rural rioting have little or nothing to do with the revolution , but the urban mobs , which were indeed directed at british authority , did not represent the class upheaval that nash assumes . the rural riots all arose out of peculiar local circumstances , and were hardly expressions of some sort of coherent class warfare . ( wood , `` new republic online review ) wood , in his review of nash 's work , went on to illustrate exactly what constituted the true dividing lines in american society when he stated : but what of all the rhetoric about the laboring people contesting the aristocratic few that nash draws on to make his case for class warfare ? there was indeed a serious division in eighteenth-century american society that reverberated through the northern states over the succeeding decades , but it was not the one that nash describes . instead of being divided between a rich upper class and a poor working class , as nash sees it , anachronistically anticipating a later nineteenth-century division between employers and employees , eighteenth-century american society was in fact still divided between a leisured gentry and the mass of artisans and other laborers who worked with their hands -- many of them the businessmen of the future . in nash 's work , he viewed many of the revolutionaries as having ulterior motives for their proclamations of equality and freedom . nash , i would argue , hinted toward the idea that the founding fathers only took part in the revolutionary movement to benefit themselves . throughout the course of the book , nash takes great care to `` expose '' the double standards of the founding fathers , making them seem as if they merely wanted to continue their `` elitists '' lifestyle at the expense of the commoners below . there is no bigger whipping boy for nash than john adams , who , according to nash , was essentially a closeted monarchist who was afraid of the people . to be sure , adams did have his reservations about the people , but it was more a fear of a `` tyranny of the masses '' than it was an outright fear that the people would displace the leaders of the new nation . however , what is truly ironic is that nash relied so heavily upon the writings of john adams to illustrate many of his points . not only did he rely on adams ' writings , but also the writings of many of the other founding fathers . throughout the course of the book , when nash referred to any of the writings of the founding fathers , i found myself wondering if nash was cropping their words to support his case . it is my belief that this is something that seriously needs to be explored in greater depth than i can provide here . what is also ironic is that nash makes little use of the narratives of those whose stories he claimed he wanted to tell . outside of the use of joseph plumb martin 's narrative of his experiences as a soldier in the continental army during the war and the autobiography of ethan allen , he does not make extensive use of the diaries and letters of many people who lived through the war experience , both in the military and in the civilian sector . to be sure , there are many diaries out there from those below who can illuminate their thoughts throughout the era . would their writings bear out what nash proposed ? nash criticized the continental congress for not being able to pay the soldiers their salaries . this inability to pay the soldiers wages stemmed from the fact that the government was essentially broke : they were unable to levy taxes on the people of the colonies because of the weak governmental structure from which they operated and many of the colonies did not pay their fair share of the financial burden of the revolution . when robert morris tried to restore fiscal responsibility to the war effort and raise revenue to provide pay and necessities to the army , nash viewed it as an attempt to `` tame the social and political radicalism of the revolution . '' ( nash , 367 ) however , i suppose nash chose to forget the fact that morris was trying to get revenue to provide for the war effort . why then would thomas paine , one who nash seemed to have great respect for his principles of democracy , agreed to author a pamphlet on behalf of robert morris in favor of his new fiscal plan . ( nash , 395 ) if morris ' plan was so stifling to democracy , intended to roll back the radicalism of the revolution , then why would paine agree to be a party to it ? not all of these explanations and questions would mesh well with nash 's outlook on morris and the founding fathers at large . further , if the founding fathers truly wanted rule for themselves , there was no better chance for one of them to establish it than with the `` newburgh conspiracy . '' it is true that the soldiers and officers of george washington 's army were deeply distraught by the ineffectual abilities of the congress to pay wages and provide for basic necessities . ( nash , 370 - 371 ) however , what nash failed to mention is the other half of the conspiracy . the men wanted to march on the continental congress and put george washington in power . washington , through an impassioned speech and performance , quelled all of these thoughts and possibly saved the revolution once again . nash , as stated previously , believed the struggle of the thousands of black slaves in the colonies was heightened by the revolutionary rhetoric that littered the landscape of the era . he believed that such literature raised their awareness and caused more unrest and rebellion than at any time previously . however , i would like to offer my own take on this . did it take pamphlets from the founding fathers to raise the awareness of the enslaved that there was something unnatural about their situation ? i certainly think not . frederick douglass ' autobiography indicates that from a very early age , he was well aware that there was something wrong with the situation he found himself . in an illustration , a still teenage douglass talked with some of his young white friends on the streets of baltimore and they complained about their lot in life . douglass illustrated the point when he wrote , `` you will be free as soon as you are twenty-one , but i am a slave for life ! '' ( douglass , 53 ) while douglass certainly is an exceptional individual , i doubt that this same premise was lost on the countless enslaved individuals in the colonies and that they wanted freedom and it did not take pamphlets for that realization to come to mind . nash lamented the `` genocidal policies '' towards the amerindians adopted by many colonists during the revolution . while it is true that atrocities were committed against the natives , first , this was nothing new by this point in american history . warfare between the natives and colonists was an almost constant from the time that european settlers stepped onto the new world . in such a climate , atrocities committed by both sides in this armed and almost perpetual struggle were inevitable . however , nash is somewhat disingenuous when he makes the native population seemingly innocent or justified in their actions . although nash admitted that the british courted and armed the native peoples to fight the colonists , even after the revolution was over , he can not seem to find any justification for the colonists to meet force with force . lastly , as stated previously , nash bemoaned how historians and the people at large have lost the viewpoint of those below the founding fathers - how the great men still consistently dominant the narrative on the american revolution . ( nash , xv ) first , i would ask mr. nash , `` should we discount what the `great men ' did during the war ? '' while historians do deal with the `` great men '' of the american revolution , i doubt there is one serious historian out there who would discount the actions and sacrifices that were made by the people below . their deeds do not go unnoticed in narratives of the war . we read about the boston tea party , we read about the non-importation of british goods and how the participation of the common people was vital to such an enterprise . we read about the plight of the continental soldier as they nearly starve and free to death in the service of their country . what nash further discounted was the explosion over the past decades in dealing with various social aspects of the history of the revolution . bruce chadwick 's piece , the first american army : the soldiers of the american revolution , he offered the reader a look into the world of the solider in the continental army through their diaries , letters and records . through these written records , we are presented with the bleak situation that so many found themselves in - conflicting interests between home and duty , the want of food and clothing , and their battle experiences . alfred young , in the shoemaker and the tea party , offers a glimpse into the world of the common man on the streets , taking part in demonstrations and actions against the british and their oppressive measures . women 's roles in the revolution are far from ignored . mary beth norton authored a book , liberty 's daughter 's : the revolutionary experience of women : 1750 -1800 , dealing specifically with the trials and tribulations of the women during the american revolution , both from the patriot side and the loyalist side . linda kerber also wrote a piece on women in the american revolution entitled , women of the republic : intellect and ideology in revolutionary america , which also draws upon the revolutionary experience of women through their diaries , letters and legal papers . the native americans receive their fair share of print as well . alan taylor wrote divided ground : indians , settlers , and the northern borderland of the american revolution , which offers a rich , sprawling history focusing on the iroquois six nations of new york and upper canada during the era of the american revolution . taylor examines indians ' wise but unsuccessful attempts to hold onto their land as colonists encroached on it . colin calloway , in his work , the american revolution in indian country : crisis and diversity in native american communities , explored the internal strife that the revolution brought to indian nations involved with the american revolution . the african-american population in the revolutionary era also received a fair amount of print about their ordeals . glenn knoblock wrote , strong and brave fellows : new hampshire 's black soldiers and sailors of the american revolution : 1775 - 1784 , which explored the military careers of over 200 black military officers during the american revolution and attempted to reconstruct their ordeal throughout the conflict . sylvia frey , in her book , water from a rock : black resistance in a revolutionary age , explored the triangular relationship between the british , the americans , and slaves in the south . through this triangular relationship , frey attempted to illustrate the complex and confusing options presented to the slaves in the south during the rebellion . beyond the founders : new approaches to the political history of the early american republic , edited by jeffrey palsey offers readers an alternative reading in the same light that nash presents , the conflicting desires of the myriad of peoples during the american revolution . the political historians contained in this work showed that the early history of the united states was not just the product of a few `` founding fathers , '' but was also marked by widespread and passionate popular involvement ; print media more politically potent than that of later eras ; and political conflicts and influences that crossed lines of race , gender , and class . thus , this work is not beholden to one particular point of view on the revolution , as nash is guilty of being caught up in . these are just some of the books out there on the myriad of topics that nash covered and , to be sure , there are many more . these books are not hard to find . just do a search on amazon 's or barnes and noble 's online stores on any of these topics and you will be presented with a cornucopia of choices - there is not quite the neglect that nash claimed in these fields . to be sure , there will still be authors who write biographies on the `` great men '' of the american revolution , but there are many who also explore the social history of the conflict . thus , nash is not the lone voice for these `` forgotten '' as he claimed"}, {"num": 1673, "context": "animal psychobabble i dislike writing negative reviews but i 'll make another exception here . my wife showed me this book one lazy saturday afternoon in a local bookstore . `` i want you to look at this . it was such a good idea but he messed it up so badly .

'' holy spirit is holding adam responsible for the entry of sin into the world . yes eve was deceived first by that serpent of old , called the devil . adam was not deceived , but disobeyed deliberately . adam was the door through whom sin entered the world . sin was the door through which death entered the world . i strongly feel that the words spoken by my savior , lord eshoo messiah ( aramaic for jesus christ ) to nichodemus in john 3:10 are applicable to marcus borg also . john 3:10 eshoo answered , you are a teacher of israel , and yet you do not undertsnad these things. ? ( 2 ) author writes : `` i see the bible as human response to god . rather than seeing god as scriptures 's ultimate author ... . the bible thus tells us about how they saw things , not about how god sees things . '' this is blasphemy . holy scriptures consisting of ( law of moshey , prophets , psalms , four gospels , book of the acts of the apostles , 14 epistles of apostle paul , one epistle of james , two epistles of peters , three epistles of john , one epistle of jude , and the lord eshoo messiah 's revelation to john ) are living word of god spoken by his prophets and apostles through the holy spirit sent from heaven . if god had not revealed himself , we will still be speculating because we are fallen and fallible creatures . i thank the lord that he took initiative and revealed himself . apostle peter writes : `` we have also a true word of prophesy ; you do well when you look to it for guidance , as you look to the lamp that shines in a dark place until the dawn of day , when the sun will shine in your hearts . '' god with wisdom created the heaven and earth in the very beginning . book of proverbs was written so that we may know wisdom and instruction ; to perceive the words of understanding ; to receive discipline , reverence , righteousness , and justice , and equity.it says the following about god 's word : proverbs 8:8-9 `` all the words of my mouth are in righteousness ; there is nothing perverse or deceptive in them . they are all plain to him who understands them , and right to those who are willing to find knowledge . '' author ignored the words of the holy spirit spoken through king solomon , son of david , wherein he writes : `` if you will turn to my reproof , behold , i will pour out my spirit upon you ; i will make known my words to you ( proverbs 1:23 . ) '' in my view , author of the book while thinking within himself that he is wise , he became fool ( romans 1:22. ) . ( 3 ) let me illustrate author 's foolishness with another blasphemy . he writes : `` but a moment 's reflection suggests that the ten commandments are also a human product and written from a male point of view. '' . i wonder if he has ever studied the book of pslams . let me just quote psalm 19 where law is called law of the lord . psalm 19:7-11 `` the law of the lord is perfect , converting the soul ; the testimony of the lord is trustworthy , making wise the young men . the statues of the lord are right , rejoicing the heart ; the commandment of the lord is pure , enlightening the eyes . the reverence of the lord is clean , enduring forever ; the judgment of the lord are true and righteous altogether . they are more to be coveted than gold ; yea , than precious stones ; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb . moreover by them thy servant is warned ; and if he keep them he shall be greatly rewarded . '' book of revelation says that : `` this is the perseverence of saints that they keep the commandment of god and their testimony of eshoo messiah , who is king of kings , lord of lords . '' apostle peter 2000 years ago had warned us of such self appointed professors when he writes : 2 peter 3:16 `` ... .. in paul 's epistles there are certain things so hard to be understood that those who are ignorant and unstable pervert their meanings , as they do also the other scriptures , to their own destruction '' . holy spirit calls such authors as `` springs without water , cloud that are carried away with a tempest ; the mist of darkness is reserved for them forever ... .. '' . `` verily it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than , after they have known it , to turn from the holy commandment that was delivered to them . '' author 's contempt for the holy scriptures can be traced to his upbringing in the lutheran church . he says : `` i was nurtured in the the lutheran church and remained lutheran until about age 30 . '' luther is not much of a roll model for anything . it is luther who showed contempt for the holy scriptures when he called book of james , `` an epistle of straw '' . luther called book of revelation , `` worthless '' . talk about having an arrogant and audacious attitude . lord eshoo messiah said `` unless we become like little children we can not enter the kingdom of god '' . by that , my savior did not mean at all that we should be childish . what he talks about is having child like trust . book of psalms tells that `` he teaches humble his way '' . and `` fear of god is the beginning of wisdom but fool despise wisdom and instruction . '' to such self appointed reformers and professors , holy spirit had issued following warning in the epistle of james : james 3:1 `` let not many of you become teachers , my brethren , knowing that as such we will incur a stricter judgment . '' luther should have kept himself busy studying god 's word instead of writing the anti-jewish tripe , `` jews and their lies '' . this book came in very handy for hitler who sent 6 millions of the seed of abraham ( jews ) to their death in holocaust - pan european event . 6th commandment , which is law of god says : `` thou shall not kill or murder '' holy scriptures says that like cloud and wind without rain is man who boast of his gift falsely . neither luther nor the author possess the gift of teaching . i am convinced that there was no reformation . things have not changed at all . in rome we have one pope on seven hills . protestant movement has produced seven popes on every dunghill ( western and eastern churches ) . lord eshoo during his earthly ministry did not speak of reformations or revivals , but instead said : `` because of the growh of iniquity ( lawlessness ) love of many will grow cold . will son of man find faith when he returns ? '' i want to cry out : help lord , godly men ceases to be , and faith has disappeared from the earth '' let me end my review with the following words of encouragement as well as warning given by the holy spirit : proverbs 30 : 5-6 `` every word of god is pure ; he is a shiled to those who put their trust in him . do not add to his words ; lest he reprove you , and you be found a liar .

'' donna jo napoli 's trademark technique of fleshing out a fairytale is in fine display in `` the magic circle , '' her retelling of `` hansel and gretel '' . napoli 's stories often reveal motivations behind some of the action that takes place in the traditional fairytales , reasoning out some of the fantastic elements and explaining the behaviour of the familiar characters ; which usually results in the villain becoming more sympathetic and understandable . such is certainly the case in `` the magic circle '' , in which she explores the background of hansel and gretel 's wicked witch . the hunchback woman is known as the ugly one by all her neighbours , but has the gift of healing which she uses to aid pregnant women and sick people in her medieval europe community . she is the proud mother of a beautiful little girl called asa , and enjoys her simple life as midwife in her country cottage . but her friend bala has other ideas , getting her work with wealthy families and in researching demonic activity so that ugly one may earn some more money - with much of the proceeds going to bala of course . ugly one is unsure about extending her talents to exclude exorcisms , knowing the danger is extremely great , but as a devout christian and a healer she feels compelled to comply with bala 's wishes - surely god will aid her , and no harm will come to her if she places herself within a magic circle that will protect her from the demons ' tricks . after cleansing a little boy from a demon 's influence , ugly one knows that she has found her new calling in life . but once several years pass , her confidence in her own abilities grow and in a mistake that will haunt her forever , she is careless with the protective magic circle . what follows is an escalating series of events that has her transformed into a witch by the vengeful demons and tied to a stake by the terrified villagers . bartering with the demons for her daughter 's life , ugly one manages to use her newfound malevolent powers to escape and hide in the forest . in napoli 's book the term `witch ' is used in the traditional christian sense , not the new age one , so be prepared for a negative usage of the word ( personally i found it quite refreshing this way - evil witches are so rare these days ! ) however , it 's not so black and white , for though ugly one can no longer shed tears , bleed or sleep , has demons whispering in her ears and an appetite for children , she is determined to not give in to her weaknesses . living in isolation , she manages to keep the demons at bay - until she hears the voices of two lost children outside her home ... napoli 's story is poignant and thought-provoking , as she raises questions concerning the nature of evil , the will of god and the strength of the individual against temptation . like all her other books , her spin on a traditional folktale is fascinating and will change your perception of `` hansel and gretel '' forever . although her interpretation of the gingerbread house is a little weak and a revelation concerning bala is raised only to be ignored , `` the magic circle '' is an intriguing little book . the demons and magical rituals mentioned are all based in real biblical and occult study ( so you 'll learn something practical alongside the retold fairytale ! ) and its length means you can probably finish it within a day . though it is not my favourite napoli novel ( that would have to be `` zel '' and `` spinners '' ) , `` the magic circle '' is a great little read ."}, {"num": 932, "context": "interesting history ... this was an interesting read . napolitano is a fox news contributor who is an advocate of interpreting via natural law and reading the constitution literally for it 's intended meaning . as a result , the fox news bashers will tend to ignore the book but it 's worthy of their attention too because the leftwing liberal idea of reinterpeting the constitution for today is what lead to legislation like the patriot act . in an unbiased way ( politically ) , his criticisms of the current administration are well-balanced with a good explanation and examples of abuse . i 've traditionally been a supporter of the republicans and the patriot act but the judge 's book have made me rethink the patriot act . i was also surprised at how far back in time some of the interpretation contraversies go , some dating back to hamilton and jefferson themselves"}], "lainey": [{"num": 372, "context": "berg at her best range of motion was my third elizabeth berg novel ( talk before sleep and until the real thing comes along being the other two ) and i must say this is by far my favorite . i loved this book from the opening line to the finishing sentence . berg portrayed her title character , lainey , with great sympathy and passion for what she loved . i loved lainey all the way through the book and she remains my favorite fiction character . throughout the novel lainey is dealing with her husband being in a coma after a freak accident along with taking care of her two daughters and helping her neighbor cope with a failing marriage . i cried along with lainey and smiled at her happy moments the entire time keeping the faith that lainey 's husband would one day wake up along with her . for any fan of berg or any reader interested in a truly great book , i highly recommend range of motion"}], "pardey": [{"num": 473, "context": "the way it 's done . what to say about this book ... it shows you wooden boat construction at its very , very best . starting with raw lumber and simple hand tools , larry pardey takes us , step by laborious step , on the odyssey of building a truly world class cruising yacht , his 30 ' taleisin . not only is every step of the hull construction detailed , but we also get `` real world '' time and cost estimates so there are no illusions as to how much time and money each step will take . there are superb `` pro and con '' treatments of aspects that have a variety of solutions . if there are multiple ways to tackle a job , he makes two columns and discusses the pros and cons of each in detail . usually you just get the author 's opinions without any extra information . this book is famous also because of it 's very important final appendix on epoxies in salt water craft , and how epoxy often is weakened to the point of failure by salt water , repeated stress , and heat - 3 things that a sailboat gets plenty of . i am told by many epoxy fans that this chapter `` is now out of date '' , but i do n't remember any amazing new epoxies coming out that make pardey 's findings defunct . george buehler says it best - epoxy works best when it 's backed up by a bolt . `` praise epoxy but pass the nails '' . also note the title `` the hull '' . that 's all you get . when it comes to decks , houses , rigging , etc. , you 're on your own . hopefully pardey will bring out volume 2 on the rest of the boat . he 's a masterful carpenter and his work is glorious and gleaming , fully among the best of yacht-quality work ever done . this is something you need to seriously soak in . this is the best , and not necessarily realistic for the average home boat builder . this book represents a set of skills that you probably do n't have , and may find difficulty developing in your lifetime , unless you are really dedicated . also , there is the time factor . it 's one thing to look at a photo of fastening planking on the frame and say `` i understand that ... i can do that !

that ancient authors wrote about it clearly.i would add that strabo in the ic.wrote in his geography of the world that the armenian political unit was created by a certain general of the army of another country on the land snatched from the iberians/moskhians ; this is in vol 5 of strabo , the loeb classical library edition in 1936 ; this is the area where the republic of armenia was created in 1918.i recently learned that its name was planned to be 'republic of erevan ' ( not armenia ) and the league of the nations promised to the government of kartu i.e . georgia that the creation of armenia in caucasia was a temporary measure-f.nansen from that league of the nations desired to create some footing somewhere in the world for refugees driven out from the balkans and that soon the league of the nations would move the republic of armenia and her armenian and other refugees-unwanted citizens of turkey-to the mediterranean.these facts are known from materials published by f. nansen available in english and some translated into russian now on the web.the creation of that republic and that of azerbaijan in 1918 in the area was the gross violation of the human rights of the indigeneous nation called by several names : the iberians , the moskhians , the kardi etc . r.heusen is absolutely right in telling readers that even before world war i , the armenians were a minority in what became the republic of armenia in 1918.after reading those truthful remarks it was a sad surprise to me to see on the next page `` a map of the historical armenia '' encompassing greater territory than the great britain.r.heusen wrote the former was 238,000 square miles against 228,000 square miles of the latter.the term armenian plateau is frequently used by the author.it is unwelcome as other names were usually used for that plateau.moses khorenatsi is discussed at several pages.it is over two centuries that he is widely denounced for being a fictitious author and therefore called pseudo-moses khorenatsi.i have thoroughly researched materials on that author in publications , in unpublished archives of prof.mikheil tamarashvili known as michele tamarati in rome and paris.many authors in xix century revealed the absurdity of the writings attributed to him : among them mr.lenormann , ilia chavchavadze criticised that pseudo author and his promoters from the mkhitarist congregation in venice- western europe for spreading false information .

'' ( 3 ) one of the great aspects of this book is that benedict 's main arguments hold true even to this day . although many of her examples may be a bit outdated from our modern perspective , her conclusions drawn from those examples are still valid . however , due to the time that it was written , 1944-6 , benedict was unable to study in japan . instead , she had to rely on articles already written about japan and interviews with japanese immigrants . in doing so , benedict is able to draw three major conclusions about the japanese : japanese society is hierarchically structured , but in such a way that allows class mobility ; that everyone has a debt , or & # 24681 ; ( on ) , they must repay to the world ; their particularistic society allows them to easily adapt to almost any situation . for example , benedict tells us that hierarchy is one of the key aspects of japanese society , so much so that they have `` what is called a `respect language . ' '' ( 47 ) this means that forms of speech are altered to reflect the status of the speaker compared to the listener . before the meiji restoration , the emperor was at the top of the hierarchy , followed by the shogun , daimyo , samurai , farmers , artisans , merchants and finally the outcasts . japan operated in this hierarchical order for hundreds of years and it worked very well . as a result of this , the japanese people learned that as long as they did not do anything outside this order `` they could trust their world . '' ( 70 ) it was a system which `` guaranteed security so long as one followed the rules . '' ( 73 ) although the meiji reform attempted , in part , to do away with these class distinctions , it was not terribly successful : samurai became powerful bureaucrats , merchants still became more and more wealthy , farmers were farmers , and the outcasts were still looked down upon - despite their emancipation . the same can be said even of today 's japan . the elite families such as mitsubishi and mitsui are still very powerful . due to their integral role in japan 's economy , they are able to sway diet members ' opinions their way . another unique aspect of japanese hierarchy , benedict tells us , is that it allows for class mobility . just because one is born a merchant 's son does not mean one has to always be a commoner . as merchants during the pre-meiji era became wealthier , they were able to marry into samurai families . in this way , the `` merchant 's descendants become samurai '' and the samurai family marries into more money . ( 72 ) although this still occurs today between wealthy and prestigious families , there is also another way to move up and gain social prestige . by studying hard and getting into the best schools , one can be sure of a secure future . if one graduates from tokyo university , it would be very difficult to not find a good job . in this manner , even a lowly farmer 's second son can be an important man . one point that should be made clear about the japanese hierarchy is that the american view of hierarchy is not quite correct . americans views it as a very rigid and controlling way of life - indeed it is . however , the authority that a father exerts on his family or a shogun over the nation is not dictatorial . the opinions and well-being of the entire group are taken into consideration before any decisions are made . `` the master of the house saddles himself with great difficulty '' if he acts purely according to his own will . ( 55 ) benedict 's second main observance of the japanese is their sense of & # 24681 ; , or indebtedness , and the need to repay it . the japanese believe , she tells us , that when a child is born , he is immediately indebted to the emperor and will never be able to repay even a one-ten-thousandth of it back . the child is also indebted to his parents . only after becoming one `` does he know how indebted he is to his own parents . '' ( 102 ) tied directly to this idea is virtue . in japan , repaying ones debts is a very important part of life . one must always be careful to remember & # 24681 ; to the emperor and the parents . therefore , it is considered a virtue when one works toward repaying any debts and as a burden to acquire more . this sense of repaying someone continues even now . it is evident in gift giving practices in which an employee gives a boss a new year 's present as a way of paying him back for employment . also , when a guest visits a family he will often bring & # 12362 ; & # 37202 ; ( sake ) or some other small present as repayment for burdening the family . a peculiar side-effect of & # 24681 ; is that people do not often help strangers in need . to do so would be to give that person & # 24681 ; they would likely not be able to repay . benedict 's final insight into the japanese culture is their ability to adapt to almost any situation . the most obvious example of this is their attitude toward the occupation . when the emperor announced the unconditional surrender of japan , the japanese considered it a natural course of events and `` accepted all that such a fact implied . '' ( 305 ) there are numerous stories of the politeness showed to american troops upon arrival in japan . even the fact that there were no resistance forces or sabotage attempts during the occupation is a strong testament to this ability . `` japan 's real strength , '' benedict says , `` lies in her ability to say ... , `that failed , ' '' and take a completely different path . ( 304 ) benedict then says japan `` could make herself indispensable in the commerce of the east , '' which could not be closer to the truth . ( 314 ) japan 's economy boomed after the reconstruction and made it the technological center of the world . of course , anyone could make such a prediction given the fact that japan was no longer allowed to have an army . all the money that had been poured into the military could now be directed elsewhere . overall , i believe the chrysanthemum and the sword accomplishes benedict 's goal of describing the fundamentals of japanese culture and is a great addition to the existing literature on japan . as i have previously stated , some of her examples are indeed old-fashioned ( i.e . the stern mother-in-law and the tale of hachiko ) and may appear irrelevant to the study of modern japan ; however , what she is able to draw from these examples is still applicable . we should consider that even though america today is much different than the america of the `40 's , the same sorts of principles are held today - this can also be said of modern japan"}], "babcock": [{"num": 525, "context": "sadist on the high seas joan druett adds her name to the growing list of authors who have , in the last few years , tackled the topic of seafaring misadventure . we have had several excellent entries in this genre , including nathaniel philbrick 's `` in the heart of the sea '' and mike dash 's `` batavia 's graveyard . '' joan druett 's book is not quite on the level of those two books- they are `` richer '' in their narrative drive and complexity- but `` in the wake of madness '' is still a good , solid `` read .

'' the people who had direct knowledge of the events preceding the mutiny did nothing to dispel this notion- to do so would have raised questions concerning their own active or passive complicity in norris 's actions and could have damaged the careers of some highly ambitious ships ' officers . it turns out that captain norris had , over a long period of time , systematically beaten and abused an 18 year old crew member ( and apparent fugitive slave ) named george babcock . a combination of floggings and backbreaking labor finally resulted in the death of babcock . worse still , it appears that norris knew , way before the final denouement , that his actions would result in babcock 's death . it was the result he was looking for . druett speculates on the motivation ( s ) : racism , anger/fear ( norris had had trouble keeping control over his crew on a prior voyage on a different ship ) , frustration ( the `` sharon '' was having very bad luck finding and catching whales ) , etc . of course , harsh discipline was nothing unusual on board ships at the time . but norris seems to have been especially brutal , even by 19th century standards . babcock at one point tried to get help from his fellow crewmembers , as he feared for his life . his mates did try to protect him , before finally yielding to the authority of the captain and his officers . why did the officers support the captain ? we have to remember that a captain was sovereign of his ship . going against his wishes could result in being branded a mutineer ... not exactly good for your career . in any event , it appears that the south sea islanders who killed captain norris were either similarly abused or felt that , given enough time , they would suffer the same fate as babcock . `` in the wake of madness '' works as both an adventure story- as mrs. druett describes the recapture of the `` sharon '' by her crew- and as something broader- as we learn a bit about the day-to-day operation of a whaling ship and of the cultural dynamics that came into play when new england whalers met pacific islanders . stopping off at the islands was a bit like playing `` russian roulette . '' on some islands , the natives were very friendly and would provide women and food for trade goods ( although they did have a propensity for stealing anything made of iron that was n't nailed down ) . on other islands you could run into cannibals or natives who would murder the crew and steal the ship . not infrequently , some crewmembers who felt misused would jump-ship at some friendly port-of-call and `` go native '' or try to `` sign-on '' with another whaling ship with a more easy-going captain . we also learn a little about life back home on martha 's vineyard . the book seems a bit abrupt and frantically paced , with mrs. druett attempting to juggle all this in only 230 pages . still , this is a generally well-written , interesting book , and worth your time"}], "constructors": [{"num": 608, "context": "entertaining and informative look at crossword construction in an age when the advent of computer-generated sudoku seem to be taking over , matt gaffney responds with this very eloquent and entertaining exploration of standard crosswords and how they are created . gaffney , an experienced puzzle constructor and editor , offers glimpses into the history of crosswords and their attributes , but the real strength of his book is its insight into the effort that constructors go in making gems for puzzlers . he discusses the way that puzzle themes have evolved over time , the limits of themed and non-themed puzzles , challenges that constructors have posed themselves , and how new-wave constructors have pushed the boundaries of puzzles using technology to help them fill grids and using their twisted brains to find ever-more-intriguing clues . this book is well written in a conversational style filled with humorous anecdotes and includes interviews with many editors and constructors . of most interest to me was a chapter in which four constructors are given partially completed grids and are asked to use their brains or computer assistance to generate `` fills '' that they think are best . the results are beautifully divergent , and the way that judges viewed them and rated them points out that the nature of `` beauty '' in crosswords is still a contested area . like amende 's `` crossword obsession '' and romano 's `` crossworld '' this book focuses on a very small field , but the thoroughness and humor that suffuse it make it a strong addition . this book will offer you insights into puzzles if you are a novice and will generate laughs of recognition and empathy if you are an expert or constructor . i recommend it . will j"}], "tetsuya": [{"num": 643, "context": "oriental haute cuisine with no gimmicks , by a master two weeks ago my girlfriend snow and i dined at tetsuya 's new restaurant mju at the millenium knightsbridge hotel in london , prompted by snow 's raving of tetsuya from her winters in sydney . the only dining option is an eight-mini-course tasting menu , but since the man himself was in town ( tetsuya spends only one week a month in london ) we were all for it . we thought the portions were adequate , but i suspect people used to nyc portions might go home hungry . i must say that his cuisine was awesome - highlighting the flavors of fresh ingredients , and many of the courses were based on raw or undercooked items . although the presentation of the food was highly stylised - just look at the photos in the cookbook and they are similarly presented at your table - the cooking is unfussed and the philosophy predominantly reflected the japanese appreciation for simplicity and french classical culinary techniques . the result was that every dish managed to emphasize yet enhance the flavor of the main ingredient . compared to nobu , tetsuya is hardly fusion and very asian at heart . most of the courses served at mju are included in the cookbook , so we know that these recipes have been tried and tested . what 's most gratifying is the listing at the end of the book of food sources for mju - london lags nyc in terms of high-end food stores such as dean & amp ;

if you have a king james version of the bible , the next time you read genesis , pay attention to how god is referred to . sometimes he 's called `` god '' and sometimes he 's called `` the lord '' . the reason for this is that the original hebrew text uses two different names for god , and the translators were careful to preserve this . when the hebrew text uses `` elohim '' it is translated as `` god '' . when the hebrew text uses `` yahweh '' , it is translated as `` the lord '' . if you carefully read genesis , you 'll notice that when genesis refers to god as `` yahweh '' , he seems to be very different than when he is refered to as `` elohim '' . for example , elohim is invisible -- he never appears to anybody nor can he be seen by anybody -- but yahweh talks face-to-face with people all the time : with abram , to jacob , and to moses and the 40 elders . elohim seems remote and regimented , whereas yahweh comes across as mischevious and irrascible . this has prompted some to propose the so-called `` documentary hypothesis '' which posits that genesis was formed by editing together two or more different books , each book using a different word for god and each book presenting a different picture of who god was and what he was all about . the book of j is the hypothasized book which used 'yahweh '' as the name of god . scholars try to reconstruct this book by bringing together all of the passages in the first 5 books of the bible which refer to god as `` yahweh '' . the result is startling : the same stories you 've heard all your life ( the tower of babal , joseph going to egypt , abram bargaining with god over sodom and gomorrah ) , when read together like this , take on a whole different level of meaning . this book provides two things in one handy volume : it provides a reconstruction of the book of j , freshly translated by david rosenberg , and it also provides an extended commentary by harold bloom , who is certainly the best reader alive today , and who is uniquely qualified to serve as a tour guide through the experience of reading j . so to review the book i 'd like to review each of these seperately . first , rosenberg 's translation . to illustrate just how good it is at bringing things out of the text which you ordinarly would n't notice , i 'd like to quote from his translation of the story of the tower of babal : `` we can bring ourselves together '' they said `` like stone on stone , use brick for stone : bake it until hard . '' for morter they heated bitumen . notice how this translation brings out the parallelism between the tower of babal and human society : the tower is made out mud bricks bound by bitumen , and society is made out of people bound by language . but people are also just made out of mud -- recall the creation story where yahweh breathes the breath of life into mud . baking the mud into bricks is symbolic of the people making themselves hard , and using bitumen for morter is symbolic of them using language and government to organize themselves . rosenberg 's translation makes available to us many of the puns and wordplay which other english translations unfortunately lose . now , to review bloom 's commentary . scholarly types are fond of dising bloom for his tendency to be speculative , to use his imagination to illuminate the reading of the text . but what they are forgetting is that j is a bunch of stories , written for us to experience ! to use an parable of rorty 's , its like a surgion describing your wife as a bunch of tissues and organs vs. describing your wife as warm and loving , important person in your life . yes , `` warm and loving '' ar n't medical terms , but that does n't make them a bad description of your wife . also , the very greatest literature , such as j is , will admit of more than one reading , more than one interpretation , more than one point of view . bloom here does us excellent service by showing us his point of view on the text , telling us how the experience of reading the text impacts him . the author of j did n't write j just to chronicle some historical figures -- the author of j wrote j so that we could read it , and by reading it , become changed into new people . _this_ is the aspect of experiiencing j which bloom 's commentary helps along , and this is the aspect which critics of bloom 's commentary are missing the most"}], "kain": [{"num": 233, "context": "athena and kain : the true meaning of greek myth the preface to athena and kain states that the content of the book is revolutionary , and it really is . i looked up revolutionary , and in the context used it means , & quot ; a total or radical change , as a revolution of thought. & quot ; there is no other book on greek art or myth like athena and kain . mr. johnson points out that greek sculptures appeared on public temples and other public buildings , and that mythological scenes appeared on the ancient greeks ' everyday pottery and storage jars . the average greeks understood the meaning of their myths . because of athena and kain , it is now possible for us to understand them , too"}], "ouroboros": [{"num": 246, "context": "a giant among giants some books are optional . `` the worm ouroboros '' , by e. r. eddison , is not . it is more than just the birth of high fantasy writing as we know it . it is a tale that connects with imagination and wonder in a way that books today simply do n't do . when you read `` the worm ouroboros '' you 'll realize that modern writers produce stories , but they do n't tell stories . since the english language fails to provide me with adequate superlatives for this review , i 'll just have to present samples of eddison 's writing : `` but a great wonder of this chamber , and a marvel to behold , was how the capital of every one of the four-and-twenty pillars was hewn from a single precious stone , carved by the hand of some sculptor of long ago into the living form of a monster : here was a harpy with a screaming mouth , so wonderously cut in ochre-tinted jade it was a marvel to hear no scream from her : here in wine-yellow topaz a flying fire-drake : there a cockatrice made of a single ruby : there a star sapphire the colour of moonlight , cut for a cyclops , so that the rays of the star trembled from his single eye : leviathans , all hewn from faultless gems , thrice the bulk of a big man 's body , velvet-dark sapphires , crystolite , beryl , amethyst , and the yellow zircon that is like transparent gold .

the husband ! the man is still the central figure and the wife is not seen as his mate , but his `` helper '' , a moon revolving around a sun . his beliefs basically come from the age-old concept of , in regards to a wife 's role , taking the biblical word `` submit '' and turning it into `` obey '' . honey , they 're not the same . submission , unlike obedience , can be mutual and does not always have to do with authority . the concept of marital submission , i believe , is basically to surrender to another 's needs and put the other before oneself ; this does not at all necessarily mean obeying ! therefore , adam 's words that the husband is never to submit to the wife were incorrect . certainly the husband is never supposed to obey his wife , but he is clearly expected to submit to her needs . the bible stresses the importance of the husband laying down his life for his wife if necessary ; that is huge submission on the husband 's part . submitting to a spouse should not be a matter of one ruling over the other , but rather a matter of both spouses making sacrifices out of love and respect for each other . adams ' words of wifely obedience were very grating to me , especially when he tried giving examples of when a wife should refuse a sinful `` command '' from her husband . if a husband freely commands his wife , we 've got bigger problems than whether the command itself is sinful or not . adam 's advice for the wife to `` respectfully '' refuse a sinful command also rather threw me , since his example of a sinful command was if a husband wanted his wife to play spouse-swap with another couple . his idea of what to say to such a husband ? `` i must respectfully say no . you must not ask me to sin and i can not do that . '' firstly , if a husband actually had the nerve to ask his wife to do something like that ( or command it , in adams ' words ) , he 'd be lucky if a disrespectful answer was all he got . secondly , i defy anyone to find a self-respecting wife who actually talks that way . the monotone of that robotic answer gave me the impression that adams ' taken this obedience thing a little too far . this impression was strengthened with his example of how a counselor should advise a woman who `` has not been a good helper '' . his advice : `` they ( wives ) must be trained to put on helpful deeds , a step many counselors overlook . '' maybe counselors overlook this because the concept of training women to be obedient helpers is , rightly , obsolete for most people . books like these , which so rigidly define the roles of spouses , have a tendency to simultaneously overcomplicate and oversimplify marriage ( not an easy thing to do , but they manage ) . they oversimplify marriage because they seem to believe that if women just obey and respect their husbands and if husbands just love and nurture their wives , the marriage will go swimmingly . it is not that simple ! marriage is not a recipe with instructions , it 's a union between two people who will occassionaly have conflicting ideas , and conflicts will not magically vanish if one spouse always gives in to the other . this method also overcomplicates things because it stresses the idea of training women to be followers rather than just letting them be led by love and respect for their husbands and letting the rest fall into place on its own . every marriage is different ; it should be godly , of course , but you can not make the roles of spouses cookie-cutter . christian books tend to do this mainly as a result of the author taking the bible too literally . adams does this by saying that , because the bible tells the husband and not the wife to love , loving is primarily the husband 's job . he went on to say that , if a husband complains that there is little love in the marriage , his counselor should tell him that it 's mainly his fault ! honestly , this alarmed me more than his earlier words about counselors training women to be helpers ( what kind of counselors are these , anyway ? ) . to automatically blame either spouse for a marital problem based on your personal interpretation of the bible instead of what 's actually happening in the marriage is a little scary ( if a professional counselor does this , it 's downright terrifying ) . the interpretation itself is rather skewed ; the bible stresses on women giving respect and men giving love because respect is something that most men already give naturally and love is already something that women give naturally . it does not mean that the husband is the only one who has to love and the wife only has to respect , so to blame a lack of love automatically on the husband is simply unfair and silly . there are plenty of women who have a hard time loving and men who have a hard time respecting ; you can not simply assume which spouse is at fault because of biblical instructions . this is not a bad book , but unless you view marriage in the same rigid terms as adams , it probably wo n't do much for you . if it focused more on mutual love and respect rather than defining one sort of behavior for one particular spouse , it would 've worked a lot better for me ."}], "vrml": [{"num": 282, "context": "bring open inventor like functionality to a browser i believe vrml 2.0 is the perfect extension for students who have studied opengl and openinventor . the & quot ; vrml 2.0 source book & quot ; brings into the light many concepts in open inventor which seem difficult to apply . interpolators , sensors , collision detection , ... etc . i applied many of the examples , into openinventor file format , rendered the scene graph , and control the scene with an open inventor widget . likewise , i was able to recreate the same functionality using a browser . understand vrml 2.0 is the next level of computer graphics , and the & quot ; vrml 2.0 & quot ; source book provides the mentorship necessary to get there"}], "carbury": [{"num": 296, "context": "fascinating read on the changing of victorian society ! i just finished this nice long read , and i must say it was very well written : trollope shows us a fascinating view of how the changes in society can affect the people living in it . we are given a view of all sorts of characters : from the volatile , swindler melmotte to the swaggering , gambling coward felix carbury , to his antithesis , his staid , country cousin roger carbury , and felix 's silly & conniving mother lady carbury , to his sweet & saintly sister hetta carbury ... the mousey marie melmotte , the marriage schemer georgiana longestaffe , the wonderful yet fallible paul montague , and the independent & brash american , mrs. hurtle . these & many other characters collide to give us a fascinating read , as their lives intertwine again & again , on so many levels . the staid & proper upper-crust victorian society of yesteryear is slowly melting away , as english virtue & honor is being overtaken by lying , cheating , swindling , stealing , and much more . where being a proper , honorable gentleman used to bring its own reward , now it is the more `` modern '' social rules that are taking effect in london society . will virtue or vice triumph in the end ?

'' donna jo napoli 's trademark technique of fleshing out a fairytale is in fine display in `` the magic circle , '' her retelling of `` hansel and gretel '' . napoli 's stories often reveal motivations behind some of the action that takes place in the traditional fairytales , reasoning out some of the fantastic elements and explaining the behaviour of the familiar characters ; which usually results in the villain becoming more sympathetic and understandable . such is certainly the case in `` the magic circle '' , in which she explores the background of hansel and gretel 's wicked witch . the hunchback woman is known as the ugly one by all her neighbours , but has the gift of healing which she uses to aid pregnant women and sick people in her medieval europe community . she is the proud mother of a beautiful little girl called asa , and enjoys her simple life as midwife in her country cottage . but her friend bala has other ideas , getting her work with wealthy families and in researching demonic activity so that ugly one may earn some more money - with much of the proceeds going to bala of course . ugly one is unsure about extending her talents to exclude exorcisms , knowing the danger is extremely great , but as a devout christian and a healer she feels compelled to comply with bala 's wishes - surely god will aid her , and no harm will come to her if she places herself within a magic circle that will protect her from the demons ' tricks . after cleansing a little boy from a demon 's influence , ugly one knows that she has found her new calling in life . but once several years pass , her confidence in her own abilities grow and in a mistake that will haunt her forever , she is careless with the protective magic circle . what follows is an escalating series of events that has her transformed into a witch by the vengeful demons and tied to a stake by the terrified villagers . bartering with the demons for her daughter 's life , ugly one manages to use her newfound malevolent powers to escape and hide in the forest . in napoli 's book the term `witch ' is used in the traditional christian sense , not the new age one , so be prepared for a negative usage of the word ( personally i found it quite refreshing this way - evil witches are so rare these days ! ) however , it 's not so black and white , for though ugly one can no longer shed tears , bleed or sleep , has demons whispering in her ears and an appetite for children , she is determined to not give in to her weaknesses . living in isolation , she manages to keep the demons at bay - until she hears the voices of two lost children outside her home ... napoli 's story is poignant and thought-provoking , as she raises questions concerning the nature of evil , the will of god and the strength of the individual against temptation . like all her other books , her spin on a traditional folktale is fascinating and will change your perception of `` hansel and gretel '' forever . although her interpretation of the gingerbread house is a little weak and a revelation concerning bala is raised only to be ignored , `` the magic circle '' is an intriguing little book . the demons and magical rituals mentioned are all based in real biblical and occult study ( so you 'll learn something practical alongside the retold fairytale ! ) and its length means you can probably finish it within a day . though it is not my favourite napoli novel ( that would have to be `` zel '' and `` spinners '' ) , `` the magic circle '' is a great little read ."}, {"num": 337, "context": "the type

an embarrassed victorian blush to righteous indignation that such things should exist at all , not to mention it being a topic for discussion among proper and civilized human beings . yet to thomas moore , a former monk and jungian analyst and writer , it is precisely this topic that needs to be explored mentally , even spiritually , in order to prevent it from erupting into anti-social , or even criminal acts in the flesh . examining the writings of the infamous marquis de sade , moore delves into the healing role of de sade that digs deeper than the surface appearance of de sade as pornographer to find value in what is cursorily dismissed as naught but tasteless perversion . according to moore 's analysis of de sade 's writing , the virgin needs the libertine to complement her chastity , as much as he needs her pristine purity to define who he is . yet , a deeper understanding of moore 's treatise on de sade reveals that wholeness is the object of the soul 's journey , and that experiencing the self as holy -- at the expense of being whole -- unjustly deprives the psyche of its completion . he believes that every human being should be in touch with his sadean side -- at least mentally -- for human potential not explored is what cripples the soul . just as there is no stick that has but one end , human potential and creativity must at least acknowledge , without necessarily favoring , the dark side of the psyche so that it 's full complexity can be known and appreciated . for moore , as well as for de sade , the perverse side of the personna that is forbidden to manifest itself mentally becomes the powerful driving force for enactment in the psycho-socially mal-adjusted person . it is perhaps society 's denial of our own dark eros that enrages and offends most when we see it demonstrated in others , for that denial surely perverts any attempt at self-knowledge , and forces the soul to assume a posture of balance and completeness that is false , lame , and ultimately unhealthy . moore hints that without personal aknowledgment of the darker depths of our psyches , as de sade so blatantly illuminates , we can not hope to soar to our greatest heights , for what we resist persists , and the chains of denial keep us tethered to terra firma instead of flying the limitless skies of our divinity . this book is not a quick read , nor is it for the judgmental or faint of heart . it requires time , and a certain willingness examine our own depths , not favoring the dark , forbidden aspects of our psyche , but rather admitting that a sadean dark eros lies hale and hearty within us all , waiting to be revealed to honest introspection for spiritual growth through courage of heart ."}, {"num": 423, "context": "easily the premier book on the

was my first time coming back to it since i read it in high school ( now almost four years ago ) . the story has stayed very fresh in my mind over the intervening years -- or , more precisely , the science of matheson 's conception of vampires . coming back to the text , it is now very obvious to me why those aspects would stick with me so strongly . for the most part , this narrative is a method of conveying matheson 's sci-fi concepts -- perhaps like any true sf author , he puts scientific concept ahead of character , and the most important aspect of the characters is not their personality or emotions but rather then impact that the story 's scientific concept has on them . in the case of i am legend , that concept is a scientific and ( mostly ) logical explanation for vampires . and it 's a wonderful , brilliant concept , more than unique and interesting enough for me to remember it in detail over the years . i still feel like the final development to this sci-fi idea and its repercussions happens too quickly and in limited detail , making the end of the book feel a little too fast -- nonetheless , the concept is a great one , and very interesting to read about . the flips side of that situation , however , is that the book lacks characterization and emotion . those aspects are n't entirely absent by any means . robert , the protagonist , has a back

these personal characteristics and even his interactions , past and present , exist primarily to move towards , expound on , and explain matheson 's scientific point , his conception of the vampires . in some cases , this is obvious : richard 's memories serve to build his character , but they also serve to lead him , and thus the reader , to a better understanding of the vampires . at a mere 160 pages , matheson could have chosen to give greater emphasis to character -- not so that it overwhelmed his sf ideas , but so that it provided a counterbalance to the emphasis on plot and idea found throughout the rest of the book . the lack of realistic and independently meaningful character makes those sections of the book unmemorable and makes the book as a whole a little bit too fast and too simple as a result . despite these thoughts and critiques , i greatly enjoy this novel and highly recommend it . matheson achieves an incredible atmosphere in i am legend , one of constant paranoia and terror that never grows stale or overblown . his sf concepts are detailed , intelligent , and truly absorbing . the book combines horror and sci-fi in a way that i have never seen anywhere else

communism , stasi ( the secret police ) or summer camps of young `` pioneers '' . in the western hemisphere i grew up , drinking pepsi coke , receiving american care packages , later on : listened to the beatles , noticed the students movement in 1968 , had no ulbrich or honecker , but chancellor willy brandt and helmut kohl . but i tried to find out the place , where the woman could live , who had born me in that dark year 1945 . after 40 years of persistent search , 1985 , before the berlin wall fell ( 1989 ) , i found out : she was living behind the `` iron curtain '' on the isle of ruegen . and i started to look at this lost childhood , which i did not enjoy : she showed me her photo album : summer beach near `` kap arkona '' at the north-point of the isle , snowy winters on hiddensee , flight ducks , cranes - but on the other hand coal heaps on washed-out sidewalks . color films ( orwo ) , books , trabi substitute parts : only hard to get . nevertheless , i wanted to make up for my life in the gdr - in 1990 when the berlin wall was fallen : a schools inspector on the island pointed into a corridor , filled with former stasi employees ( security police ) and informed me in this manner in an almost dumb `` cadre conversation '' , he unfortunately ( thanks to the `` reunification '' of east and west-germany ) would have to hide many people in the teaching

so-called balance sheets suicide . i was deprived of the chance to become a `` zone child '' a second time . did i miss really much ? because the book of jana hensel has stimulated me to these

"context": "`` she thinks last of her child . '' nora roberts , writing as j.d . robb , has created a successful series based on a few basic principles . the first , and in my opinion , most important aspect is a fascinating heroine , who presents different layers that the author has been revealing in each installment and will certainly continue to do so . lieutenant eve dallas is a tough cop , who is relentless in her pursue of justice and feels as if the victims were hers to save . on the other hand , she is the wife of the billionaire roarke , and has to deal with parties and charity events in which she is expected to mingle and maintain polite chit-chat with the guests . she has been adjusting slowly to this area of her life and even though she does not like it , she has learned to accept it . the fact that eve was abused by her father when she was a child and had to kill him in order to escape also plays an important role in the development of the story and in almost every case eve faces . her husband also has a complex past , involving an abusing father who killed roarke 's mother and then lied to him about who his real mother was . only recently did the billionaire learned the truth about this and reunited with what was left of his family . besides the two main characters , robb has created a supporting cast that adds appeal to the series and which i consider to be the second factor in its success . peabody is eve 's former aide and current partner who has recently made detective and who usually adds a good part of humor to the narration with her witty comments . she is in love with mcnabb , a policeman working in the electronic detectives division , and they are in the process of moving together to a new apartment . there are other interesting characters : feeney , eve 's trainer and mentor , mavis , eve 's best friend , nadine furst , a reporter for channel 75 who has become a close friend with eve , charles , a licensed companion who is now dating a doctor , and several others . one of the most appealing aspects of the series has to do with the development of the stories of each of these people , and that is why i recommend reading the series in order . the third and final element that helps create a superb series is the cleverly crafted world in which the action takes place : new york in the year 2059 . the setting presents several characteristics that make it very different from our world , like cars that fly , drones that take care of household chores , the ban on firearms , the anticancer vaccine , the legalization of prostitution , the difficulty for getting real coffee , etc . also , the advances in terms of technology require criminals to be more clever and careful when committing their crimes , and we usually end up reading about complex mysteries . in this novel , eve is summoned to the scene of a ghastly murder . the victim was raped and strangled using a red ribbon and before leaving , the killer took out her eyes as a memento . the poor woman had a four-year-old kid and worked as hired help for a wealthy couple , and there is nothing that indicates that someone would have wanted to hurt her . everything is business as normal until celina sanchez shows up wanting to talk to eve and claiming she has information about the murder . celina is a psychic and claims that she saw the killing in a vision . even though eve does not really believe in this stuff , she goes along with it following peabody 's advice and realizing that if it does not help at least it will not hurt either . this is not the first time robb uses supernatural events in the series , but in her previous attempt she went too far making it hardly believable . in the present try the results were much better , and since the case eve is facing is one of the best mysteries in the series so far , the overall quality of the novel benefits even more . as usual , robb creates a good balance between the police procedural and the development of the personal stories of the characters in the series . of course , the romantic scenes are still present through the narration , but without overdoing it . i was very pleased with this installment , and i am looking forward to the next one . a final word of advice , the publisher 's blurb gives out important information regarding events towards the end of the novel . i would have preferred to read the book without knowing these facts . the good thing is that even if you read them , there will be a surprise waiting for you"}, {"num": 827, "context": "amazing story the book the first part

breaking out of their own fields to combine ideas into revolutionary new areas of study . johansson asserts ( and correctly so , in my opinion ) that innovation thrives in these `` intersections '' that are missed by many , but offer the best chance for breaking away from the `` same old thing '' . the book is extremely practical , in that all the chapters are driven by real-life examples of these intersectional thinkers . you 'll see how richard garfield combined the idea of collectables and gaming to come up with the mega-hit card game magic : the gathering . the singer shakira takes musical styles from widely different cultures and combines them into a sound that is all her own ( and very popular to boot ) . eric bonabeau studied the activities of ants searching for food and applied the observations to network routing and scheduling . these and many other examples show how being a generalist ( or at least open to other fields ) can lead to connections not possible for highly specialized thinkers . johansson lays out steps you can take to place yourself in that constant flow of ideas , so that you can start seeing new possibilities in rather mundane unrelated things

mcginn , divinity school , university of chicago , wrote in the introduction , & quot ; i believe that all students of mysticism should read scholem , not only for his profound insights into the jewish mystical tradition , but also to deepen their understanding of the dynamics of other mysticisms -- christian , islamic , and even those further afield. & quot ; professor scholem presents an historical perspective with the full knowledge that there are other approaches . & quot ; from an historical point of view & quot ; , he writes , & quot ; the sum of religious phenomena known as mysticism consists in the attempts of mystics to communicate their experiences to others. & quot ; within this context , this text explores broad sweeping topics in each chapter -- topics that deservedly have receieved attention by intelligent scholars for centuries . in the first chapter , & quot ; religious authority and mysticism & quot ; herr doktor scholem presents a thesis fundamental to his research , & quot ; there is no mysticism as such , but only the mysticism of particular religious systems , christian , islamic and jewish mysticism , and so on & quot ; . the mystic working within a religious system is , according to scholem , at the same time both conservative and revolutionary . & quot ; conservative & quot ; because the mystic tries to preserve the sources of traditional authority , and & quot ; revolutionary & quot ; because the mystic also may subsititue his own opinion for that prescribed by authority . in the second chapter , titled , & quot ; the meaning of the torah in jewish mysticism & quot ; , scholem explains the dynamic relationship between the torah and the mystic . scholem presents three fundamental principles on which the kabbaslistic conceptions of the nature of the torah are based : ( 1 ) ywvh ; ( 2 ) torah as oganism ; ( 3 ) infinite meaning of the divine word . as an example of the third , in addition to the the concept of written and oral torahs , the author of the & quot ; zohar & quot ; speculates four levels of meaning : ( 1 ) literal ( 2 ) hermeneutic ( 3 ) allegorical and ( 4 ) mystical . the history of judaism , scholem explains in the third chapter , is a tension between the purity of the reality of god . the dynamic involved is clearly presented in the realization that the price of god 's purity is the loss of her living reality . scholem offers that the book bahir , a cornerstone of 12th century kabbalistic thought , introduces myth into judaism . remarkably , it contends evil as an attribute of god . in a similar vein , the commentary on the sefer yetzirah by judah ben barzilai introduced speculative thinking to jewish theosophy . the fourth chapter , & quot ; tradition and new creation in the ritual of the kabbalists & quot ; presents a solution to a problem faced by each new generation . namely , how are the traditions passed on in a vital and meaningful medium . the mishnal codified jewish religious law and ritual for an agrarian community had survived for centuries . as the agrarian society diminished , the torah became obsolete and the natural rituals became less meaningful , historical rituals . the spanish kabbalists found a new ritual to express the old traditions . scholem writes , & quot ; the rejuvenation of religion repeatedly finds its expression in a return to ancient images and symbols , even when these are 'spiritualized ' and transformed into speculative constructions. & quot ; r. yanassan gershom has already succinctly summarised the fifth chapter which deals with the concept of the golem . i will take the liberty to direct you to his comments . if you are interested in historical issues of the kabbalah , this is essential reading for you"}, {"num":

'' there are , obviously , dozens of books about this man and his actions that touch on topics that books like god and george w. bush will not even acknowlege , much less discuss , defend , or justify . to ignore these other sources of information is to be possibly tragically misinformed . while i do not doubt that many of the previous reviews come from good and intelligent people , i am forced to wonder how they can support a man who performs acts , or at least allows them to be performed , that are every bit as vile as that which he claims to oppose . read other books and you will see . one subject that always makes me wince is the labeling of those fighting our soldiers as evil . i am not supporting them or denouncing our own , but merely urging all of us to recognize the humanity of others . labeling a people as evil undermines their humanity and suggests that they do not have good reasons to be fighting , but that they fight simply to overcome those who `` love freedom . '' this is from page 114 of this very book , ( a quote from phyllis wheatley ) `` in every human breast , god has implanted a principle which we call love of freedom .

see for yourself if you can answer such a question . also , see if you can discover , honestly and objectively , the freedoms that we are currently fighting for . another huge bother for me in this book is that kengor refers to texas as the largest state in the nation . it 's difficult to take the rest of his scholarship seriously when he makes such a statement . another horrific , to my mind ,

finance.during a visit to america in 1944 as the representative of england 's treasury department , keynes totally disagreed with lerner 's approach.keynes 's approach is an advanced version of the cyclically balanced budget first laid out in clear terms to the pharaoh by joseph some 3,700 years ago-build up a surplus in the good years that will cover the deficits of the bad years.this is the first statement of what economists call a countercyclical fiscal policy.keynes 's additional provision is that the budget be split into two categories-one of which would be a capital budget.the government could only run deficits in the provision of capital projects in public infrastructure ( building dams , reservoirs , water projects-irrigation networks , seaports , airports , public transportation projects , public schools , colleges and universities , public research laboratories , etc. , ) that would pay for themselves in the long run.nor was keynes an advocate of tax cuts in an economic downturn except for temporarily suspending the social security tax for workers only.keynes 's major policy recommendation was the maintenance of low interest rates combined with a central bank policy of eliminating loan availability for speculative undertakings ( greenmail , leveraged buyouts , hostile takeovers , margin account loans , corporate raiders , junk bonds , etc . ) .the correct title for jmb 's book up until 1981 is '' democracy with minor to moderate deficits : the political legacy of the american keynesian-neoclassical synthesis school '' .after 1981 , jmb should have retitled his book as '' democracy and catastrophic deficits : the political legacy of laffer , reagan , and the 12 years of the two bush presidencies '' .the national debt when president reagan took office stood at 925 billion dollars.as of july,2005 , the national debt will have surpassed 8 trillion dollars.the libertarian-pseudo conservative policies of tax cuts , borrowing and excessive spending of 8 years of reagan and 12 years of the two bush presidencies has increased our national debt by a factor of 9.jmb needs to completely rewrite his book.first , he needs to incorporate the theoretical foundations of the story of joseph and the pharaoh from the old testament.he will probably need to purchase a bible in order to correctly cite verse and page.second , he needs to obtain a

now , after 40 years , it appears in print , no longer only the stuff of legend , but an actuality exposed to real scrutiny . frankly , the wait has not been worth it . exhaustively drafted from every

example : the plan of the casa del fascio , eisenman `` discovers '' , is a square , or rather , almost a square . in order to satisfy eisenman 's supposition , the true square , it seems , is realized only when particular window is opened fully to the 90 degree position , thereby implying a volumetric extension of the building , which then completes the so-called purity of the geometry . the fact that other windows on other sides of the building might also be opened at the same time thereby undermining the purported geometrical purity , does not seemed to have occurred to the author

through his design . eisenman stretches similar guesswork beyond the point of irritation as though insulting the intelligence of his readers is one of the underlying purposes of this book . in the

( with what was salt purchased from tortuga ? there was no cash available , and credit with fithian seems unlikely to have extended there . ) islands other than the fictional devon island ( e.g . tighlman island ) suddenly become important at the end of the book , and are referenced as `` the old rivals of patamoke . '' if they are old rivals , why did n't they appear before ? did this get cut out of the book ? my third concern is a very strange charge to levy against michener . as anyone who has seen the musical `` south pacific '' knows , michener is strongly opposed to racism . certainly in this book there are whites , blacks , and indians of the full range of character and talent . however , the book still seems to have a strange racist undertone that i ca n't shake from my mind . it comes from how michener ties his story together across the centuries . every janney is feckless ( except for the one who becomes a steed ) . every steed is enterprising , although not necessarily industrious . every turlock is craven . every cater is proud , even if this is expressed differently across the generations . every paxmore is upstanding , even the sad-sack pusey paxmore believes he is acting in an upstanding manor until he looks back on what he 's done . one steed even refuses to acknowledge her own grandchildren because they have turlock blood in them , and is praised by the author for doing so . i realize that michener was using a shorthand to help the reader keep characters straight across the centuries , but the result is rather too `` geneticist , '' arguing that genes determine destiny"}, {"num": 190, "context": "a great book for the early childhood classroom this book helps you look at the big picture from beginning to end . nature should exist in the classroom all year around . i love the open ended growing activities and setting up a growing center . i 'm in the process of doing this in my classroom and the children love it . check out their other books on structures and water too !"}, {"num": 195, "context": "delicious , with a wee aftertaste even in paperback this is a thick and heavy book , which is a compilation of several of mkf fisher 's individual works offering different aspects of her thoughts on food in terms of origin , recipes , culinary preparation , and history . in addition , it divulges her own observations on the whole dining experience that we as humans go through in terms of customs , etiquette , ambience , socializing and so forth . but what makes this book stellar is the eloquent , imaginative , and sometimes even haunting style of ms. fisher 's writing . she expresses her own thoughts and oftentimes outspoken opinions , mixing them with historical facts , tempting recipes , and home-cooked tales . with such a satisfying horn of plenty within the confines of two book covers , it is easy to understand why she still reigns as the queen of prose inspired by food and dining . i wish i had her ability to master in writing such joi de vivre and enthusiasm for food , eating , and drinking , which after all are such basic elements to our very existence . the section i enjoyed most of all was `` the gastronomical me '' , a biography-cum-travelogue in which she poignantly narrates her experiences by rendering them so lifelike that you can smell the smells and taste the tastes . she includes food episodes of her early years in california while growing up and later attending boarding school ; in dijon , france where the kitchens in restaurants and her apartments beckon you to partake of the offerings ; in switzerland where you visually can grasp the mountains and streams along train-rides she describes through the alps to italy ; and finally in a small mexican town , where she surpasses even the writing prowess demonstrated in her previous stories , by telling the most poignant tales . an interesting sidelight is that this book not only covers food . you gather early on that she is far from a teetotaler since alcoholic drinks and drinking at mealtimes too are frequent topics , from sipping wines and champagnes and glasses of pernod on ocean liners to mixing water with bourbon , which she keeps in a flask during a long , propeller-driven , airplane flight to mexico . the other sections i liked were the beginning ( serve it forth ) and consider the oyster . it amazed me that one person could write a whole expose covering around a hundred pages about only the oyster : the various types , methods of preparations , and culinary history . plus she gives her own personal memories and anecdotes too . you name it , she said it about oysters -- recipes included . i did not care as much for how to cook a wolf , as i could not relate to either the off-color humor or to some of the topics she presented . ( sorry , but sweetbreads , halves of calf heads , and brains were not appetizing subjects . ) also , i gave up finishing the book . i started to read `` an alphabet for gourmets '' , the last section , but got as far as `` d '' and could n't force myself to read through the rest of the alphabet . it seems to me by the time in her life when she wrote this section she had become rather cynical and bitter , to the extent that everything she wrote sounded condescending . this section was such a let-down , a depressant to me after coming off the high of `` the gastronomical me '' . although i exaggerate , she seemed to repeatedly state something to the effect that she preferred to dine alone on crackers and milk rather than face gourmet meals with uncultivated people ( with untrained palettes ) who were unsavvy as to the proper way food should be eaten in the first place and incapable of appreciating what they shoved in their faces in the second . anyway , other readers may disagree with me , but this last section lacks the consistency , and more important , the vibrancy and pep of her flowing , off-the-wall style that grows on you in the other sections . although i was a little disheartened at the end , her brilliance that shone through in the other sections more than outweighed the few negatives . i can recommend this book to everyone , especially to people who are interested in food as a literary subject in its own right instead of something that we simply cook and eat . of course , foodies and cooks alike should appreciate it . and though it does have some very good recipes as added bonuses , this should not be considered a cookbook ; instead , this book 's function is to serve up delicious tidbits for our minds and imaginations to savor and enjoy ."}, {"num": 196, "context": "the first of a great series at first blush , the everard family does n't look like much on which to base a series of heroic sailors . hugh , drummed out of the service before the war in some unnamed scandal but pulled back in because of the emergency , is in love with his brother john 's wife . john , a general in the army in france , does not make an appearance , but his sons nick and david do . nick is feckless and irresponsible , just one step ahead of being drummed out of the royal navy himself , while david is more professional if somewhat dull . that in the course of the book , one 's opinion of everyone changes 180 degrees is a tribute to the author 's skill at both showing character development and also at revealing a character 's past layer by layer , like peeling an onion . the criticism commonly made about this book merely shows the inability of some critics to appreciate the intent of the book they are reviewing . yes , the book is choppy and yes , it is hard to follow the course of the action . one 's initial impulse is to wish for maps and an appendix , but then you realize that this is the whole point . fullerton 's goal is to present to the reader exactly how fighting the battle of jutland felt to those who were there . jutland was a confusing battle and it was many days before those who were there had the foggiest notion of the sequence of events . fullerton has studied the battle carefully and everything that happened in real life happens here at exactly the same time . but you ca n't construct a coherent whole out of the narrative , just as even lord jellicoe was n't able to do so . for that , you need to consult another book ( i would recommend rules of the game by andrew gordon , which is not only the finest description of the battle , but one of the finest works of military history ) , but do it after you read this book , so that you get the full flavor of the writer 's intent . very few writers capture the fog of war as well as fullerton does"}, {"num": 197, "context": "it 's how we remember i , like most of my women friends i 've talked to , including my mother and my sisters , shape memories and moments based on the clothes we were wearing at the time . i bought this book in 1995 when it was first published and have referred to it several times over the years for inspiration and support . i found it in the `` self-help '' section of the bookstore . this little book does as good a job as anything i 've read , at getting in a woman 's head . clothes are how we remember . wearing our favorite clothes or shoes or carrying our favorite handbag gives us confidence and helps us cope . for a while , i kept a diary of drawings of outfits whenever i 'd want to remember an important event . ask me what i was wearing when i held my niece for the first time ( navy blue a-line liz claiborne dress ) or when i went to my first job interview out of college ( a polka-dot suit i called the stewardess ) or the night i was first kissed by the love of my life ( a shirt that said `` keep on truckin '' in glitter ... heh ) . a good friend 's mother passed away a few months ago , and i bought a copy for her , since ms. beckerman mentions the death of her own mother . she also mentions marriages , divorces , babies , and career successes , and most importantly , what she wore . it makes a great gift for any woman . or for yourself"}, {"num": 202, "context": "great book , i loved it ! first , a word about the publishers . . . somewhere it is decreed , i suppose in the regency genre publishing house , that all `` regency romance '' books must be exactly 218 pages , no more and no less , so that if one author writes less , they make the letters nice and big , three paragraphs to a page . . . and if another author has a longer story , the publishers will squeeze ten paragraphs , in tiny letters , onto one page . . . this is one of the books where you have ten paragraphs ( or more ) per page , plus there is so much going on in the story that the plotline is constantly changing . . . for me , this made for some frustrating reading . but as for the story itself - this is my first by allison lane , and what i see , i like . i was pre-warned that she is a `` darker '' regency author , so that i did not find the issues explored in this story shocking . yes , it 's sad , but , unfortunately , there really are parents like that .

'' and it 's quite another to realize how many hundreds of hours are involved in just a few of the aspects of the hull construction . pardey could work on his yacht full time - he did n't need to do other work to pay the bills . he was also in the prime of his health . most americans only have this kind of time if they 're retired , and that often means not as strong as we once were . if we 're young and strong it means we have to work for a living . so , this particular boat might be best aimed at the youngish man who does n't have to work very much for his living . either that or you 'll spend about a decade of weekends on this boat . if you want to get on the water a little quicker than that , consider george buehler 's `` backyard boat building '' , for salty and sea worthy crusising yachts that the average man or woman can build themselves in a year or two , and actually take to the caribbean , or further . i 'm not saying do n't aspire to pardey 's level , but remember that you live in the real world . it 's better to build a simple boat than to not build a fancy one . it 's better to go sailing than it is to spend your free weekends for 2 years screwing down teak decking . but , that consideration aside , there is no better guide to traditional yacht construction than this"}, {"num": 490, "context": "systematic theology is an outstanding theological work to be quite frank with you , i was simply going to come online and recommend that you do not buy the abridged version , but make certain that you are getting the full , unabridged 4 volume set . however , i was surprised at reading one review which makes a comparison to monty python . that reviewer also suggested that chafer 's approach was for a believer to check their mind at the door of a church before entering . i must admit , i have no idea where this person is coming from . chafer has one of the most careful , logical and systematic approaches to theology that i have ever read ( and i have a huge library ) . i know of several pastors whose ministry was changed profoundly because of this one book . there is nothing anti-intellectual about chafer 's approach ; there is nothing which is dumbed-down . bear in mind , this is a 4 volume set . my abridged version is about 1000 pages . in particular , chafer 's approach to the angelic conflict is exemplary . i have only one criticism , and that is with the abridged version : somethimes , a point will be made which is true , but the scripture quoted is not directly on point . i do not know if that is the fault of chafer or the fault of the abridged text . my recommendation is , if you are going to own just one book ( or set of books ) which cover nearly the entire realm of doctrine , this should be it ."}, {"num": 522, "context": "want sk 's scariest short story ever ?

german democratic republic , `` wuppertal '' should be `` west-germany '' ( american sector ) , the isle of ruegen became russian sector , behind the `` iron curtain '' . so i did not learn anything about `` young pioneer meetings '' , socialism , communism , stasi ( the secret police ) or summer camps of young `` pioneers '' . in the western hemisphere i grew up , drinking pepsi coke , receiving american care packages , later on : listened to the beatles , noticed the students movement in 1968 , had no ulbrich or honecker , but chancellor willy brandt and helmut kohl . but i tried to find out

behind the `` iron curtain '' on the isle of ruegen . and i started to look at this lost childhood , which i did not enjoy : she showed me her photo album : summer beach near `` kap arkona '' at the north-point of the isle , snowy winters on hiddensee , flight ducks , cranes - but on the other hand coal heaps on washed-out sidewalks . color films ( orwo ) , books , trabi substitute parts : only hard to get . nevertheless , i wanted to make up for my life in the gdr - in 1990 when the berlin wall was fallen : a schools inspector on the island pointed into a corridor , filled with former stasi

6-8 inches . his vivid description of the aftermath , death and suffering is chilling . he provides recounts of several individual and family experiences that are touching to say the least . the events leading up to the disaster are vividly delineated as well . the south fork fishing and hunting club was established by a small group of super-elite americans ( e.g . carnegie ) . the club was situated up the valley from johnstown , pennsylvania . the dam that held the lake fished by the elite suffered the brunt of much scrutiny in the years preceding the disaster . many argued that it 's poor design and integrity made it vulnerable to giving way in the event of heavy rains . the dam bursting was talked about for years preceding the event . many joked about it , but most thought such a calamitous event to be highly unlikely . following a late spring holiday parade in 1889 , the `` impossible '' occured . the dam gave way , and the lake entered the valley , sweeping locomotives , train tracks , woods , houses , stores along with it . entire small communities were enveloped by the heap of muck and debris on the way to johnstown . the death toll was some 2200 . mccullough paints vivid pictures of the event itself as well as the suffering in the aftermath . the corpses and muck posed and immense public health threat , with a typhoid outbreak following the disaster . the blame was quickly placed on the elite members of the south fork fishing and hunting club for neglecting upkeep on the dam that held their precious little weekend and holiday reserve . it 's a tale of early conspicuous consumption , and disturbing to find that the wealthy members of the club refused to take blame for anything . along the way , mccullough provides historical detail of the industrial revolution in its beginnings . the development steel mills , railroads , refineries , labor conditions , and business dealings of the financially elite are all intertwined in his recount of johnstown . also , details of death counts at the make shift morgues , financial support during the aftermath ( president harrison sent a personal check in the amount of $ 300.00 ) and a list of the names of the dead bring the story to life for the reader . eerie recounts of coroners ' descriptions of corpses in their logs will make your skin crawl . clara barton began organizing the american red cross in 1881 . she had worked on more minor floods in the valley prior to 1889 . her work at johnstown earned her dinner with the president harrison in washington following her five months of pure dedication

'' let 's look at the semicolon and the word `` thus '' . last time i checked , a person is suppose to use a comma after and independent marker ; thus , a comma comes after 'thus ' . is the missing comma suppose to be some type of associated press ( ap ) writing editorial punctuation ? you could smack me with a stick for not reading the ap style guide , but it would have been nice if the author and the copyeditors noted what was going on . some of the material and possible errors at this point make me question if i should continue reading the book . i looked up semicolon in the index , and it was about 30 or so pages ahead of the past page i was at . i noticed the semicolon was feared by the author and not brought out in detail . i 'm not chuckling . i 've questioned a few of the matters in this book . i 've been able to accept press vs. academic so far , but i 'm starting to get concerned if what i 'm learning is correct or not . i grabbed the book from the library to learn . however , if these are mistakes , then i 'm a novice writer learning mistakes that were n't meant to be mistakes . i do n't think that 's a good way to learn how to write . do you ? let 's go to the their vs. his or her debate : i do n't care who or what you are , i 'm going to use his or her . if something is singular , it 's going to stay that way . i do n't approve of the media or some other brainwashing superpower to change the rules of english grammar . this is why i 've got to love some of the reviews on amazon.com . people do n't seem to care about grammar . makes me feel like someone is trying to sell me snake oil and the people around me are conspiring with the retailer . apparently , i 'm not the only one that feels this way . not after reading the rest of the reviews here . may i mention that amazon.com was advertised in the book ? yeah . thanks for dumbing down grammar . another section was where he used a comma instead of a semicolon to creates sentences like the following : page 91 : i like trix , i like lucky charms , and i like cocoa pebbles . maybe i 'm missing something here ; maybe he was trying to detail something ; maybe he 's adhd and forgot ; and maybe the book is adhd . i like trix , lucky charms , and cocoa pebbles . thank you parallelism . a person is suppose to use a semicolon instead of this serial comma junk he 's selling ; however , this could be a style concern . another entry about style and its concerns with semicolons could have been inserted . yeah . i 'm done reading after 60 pages or so . at least i read more than a fifth of the book . parts of the book i liked : introduction to brackets . it may not have been correct , but i understand what it 's about . `` i 've written a stylebook that i hope makes the following point : be skeptical of stylebooks .

this fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy , let alone female sexuality . it 's also mean-spirited . lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman , and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept . this is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal . he drips way too much contempt . everything outside of sex is dumb , meaningless , ridiculous . attempting to derive enjoyment from the `` mental life '' makes one ridiculous ; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous ; trying to have sex in any way outside lawrence 's own true and correct way makes one pathetic , or defective , or spiteful ; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of `` woman '' or `` man '' ; and so on . looking at italian art is stupid . everything in paris is stupid . constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in france knows how to have sex properly . reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what 's `` wrong '' with everyone except c. and m. , one might easily conclude that constance does n't really seem happier now that she 's sleeping with the gamekeeper , and hilda does seem happier in venice - the author counters this by ridiculing `` that kind '' of happiness as delusional and druglike . he even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there 's something wrong with her . of course constance is wretched , because she does not have that one thing that , in lawrence 's view , really matters in life - not mellors , but mellors ' equipment . this book does degenerate into phallus-worship , which makes the author 's hostility toward `` druglike '' pleasures seem sort of ironically comical . hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures : from venice , from the feel of the sun , from jazz , from dancing . this seems weird to me - as if lawrence is punishing the uppity woman . hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a `` user '' , with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man , only to walk away when the dance is over . ( this may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist , since obviously lawrence does n't mind if mellors is callous and behaves as a `` user '' . ) it 's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one 's body . everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex , but his notion of real sex . this is where astute readers will have the most trouble . lawrence clearly defines a `` real '' woman - constance chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples . a woman who lays there `` unfeeling '' is clearly an example . such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc . lawrence does n't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or is n't doing could even be related ; it 's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically , but in character . on the other hand , a woman with an unfeminine urge to be in control - that is , one who insists on moving herself , rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when michaelis is the male ( because he 's premature , and meant to be pathetic ) , but it turns unforgiveable when it 's women in general and especially mellor 's bertha , who just refused to come when she should out of spite . bertha just had a sick ( ! ) urge to be in control , demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature . the only thing mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he `` spoilt '' her . as for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy ? forget it . lawrence suggests that mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch , but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental , nothing important . a real woman does n't need foreplay . just hop on and go , and if she 's what she ought to be , she 'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later . these were what i found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman 's duty is to lie there , not too passive , but not too active , and come when she 's supposed to ( and if she does n't , it 's her own fault ) ; while a man 's job is to climb on top and `` perform '' . all of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are , unfortunately , not true . the truth is that a woman 's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis ; there 's a thing that both males and females start out with , which in a man becomes the penis , and in the woman becomes ( or remains ) a clitoris . lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part . women have always known about their own bodies ; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things , preferably apart from what women think men `` want to hear '' . this , too , is no doubt why it has been accused of being `` sexist '' . the author ( or at least mellors ) openly blames women who can not or will not `` come to the crisis '' when she ought , as if it were entirely of the woman 's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man . it 's also likely that science will eventually prove ( if it has n't already ) that women like constance chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be ' emotionally as well as physically . for all that lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly , even noxious emotions and desires - such as `` intimacy '' and `` connection '' , both of which he has constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act , but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences , based on the notion that a man 's biological job is to get his dna out there , while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment . if this is true , it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant , not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child . so - while there may or may not be women who feel as constance does , at the same time it 's not so clearly obvious that a woman `` should '' feel that way , as to justify lawrence 's open belittling of women whose emotional states do n't match masculine emotional detachment and distance . there 's a lot of talk of `` tenderness '' - in fact , constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in venice of somehow `` lacking tenderness '' - but quite frankly i am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender . the only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her , but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find . i can imagine a woman putting up with - but i can not imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk , who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal ( remembering she 's a lady ) when she asks him questions , who calls her c -- t as if that were her name , and generally treats her as if she were a whore . i could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of , but this is how their relationship really is ; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he wo n't say and the questions he wo n't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible . for what it 's worth , i think life will be better when this book has become obsolete . it is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages , if not their selves . those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion . as for those who just want a good read - i 'd call it a matter of personal taste . obviously some people enjoy this book .

'' note that this book was published back in 1995 , so that word was not as prevalent in western discourse as it is now , but barber still uses the term as a loose descriptor which is likely to offend both devout muslims and ardent anti-islamists . when it comes to the specifics , many reviews here and elsewhere list out the numerous flaws in barber 's arguments , and there are so many of them that a lot of reviews are necessary for the task . you can agree or disagree with various critiques of barber 's contentions based on your own personal politics . but everyone will probably conclude that in this book 's final section he does not deliver on the ironic implications of his initially intriguing thesis ( embodied in the book 's title ) , and simply forwards borrowed theories on civil society and the public sector . overall , this book is mostly the longwinded grumblings of a nostalgic know-it-all who portentously predicts doom for every single cultural and political reality of the modern world .

'' do n't try to say that baptism is a good work and compare it to ephesians 2:8 and take it out of context . salvation requires : believe , confess , repent , baptism , and living by your faith . that is the belief that jesus and the apostles have passed down for 2000 years . so j , you can go ahead and listen to thought of the last 25 to 100 years by man , but as for me , i will listen to the scriptures and to jesus and to paul and the apostles . for paul says in galatians 1:12 `` i did not receive it from any man , nor was i taught it ; rather , i received it by revelation from jesus christ .

keynesian-neoclassical synthesis school of economics.lerner used the term functional finance to describe deficit finance.during a visit to america in 1944 as the representative of england 's treasury department , keynes totally disagreed with lerner 's approach.keynes 's approach is an advanced version of the cyclically balanced budget first laid out in clear terms to the pharaoh by joseph some 3,700 years ago-build up a surplus in the good years that will cover the deficits of the bad years.this is the first statement of what economists call a countercyclical fiscal policy.keynes 's additional provision is that the budget be split into two categories-one of which would be a capital budget.the government could only run deficits in the provision of capital projects in public infrastructure ( building dams , reservoirs , water projects-irrigation networks , seaports , airports , public transportation projects , public schools , colleges and universities , public research laboratories , etc. , ) that would pay for themselves in the long run.nor was keynes an advocate of tax cuts in an economic downturn except for temporarily suspending the social security tax for workers only.keynes 's major policy recommendation was the maintenance of low interest rates combined with a central bank policy of eliminating loan availability for speculative undertakings ( greenmail , leveraged buyouts , hostile takeovers , margin account loans , corporate raiders , junk bonds , etc . ) .the correct title for jmb 's book up until 1981 is '' democracy with minor to

'' nothing about tribulation and nothing about enduring tortures ! ! ! you are just making up scripture , perverting the gospel ! now verse 4 talks about troubles ( lower-case `` t '' ) , hardships , distresses , etc . that is happening now , today until jesus comes back with a commanding shout and trumpet call of god to take us to heaven and those against him into eternal judgement - no 7 year tribulation period ! ! ! live today like it was your last day , because you could die or jesus could come back ( and believe me , you will know it because until you can show me verses where a silent , secret rapture will take place and there will be those left behind battling for seven years , i will continue to follow the god-breathed word of god and not fluff of lahaye and jenkins . `` tribulation '' is found once in the bible ( rev 7:14 niv ) and it is with a lower-case `` t '' and has nothing to do about what the books suggest . `` rapture '' never appears as this is a word that has n't been around that long . so in summary , jesus is coming back and we will know about it ( whether you are a christian or not ) . and off the subject , yes , baptism is essential to becoming a christian and being saved ( not praying jesus into your heart ) ... it seems that the same people who believe in lahaye 's rapture are usually wrong on that issue as well . please do yourself a favor . read the bible and follow it . if you do that , then you wo n't be led astray by these false teachings of someone like j. czecholinski who can not even get his scriptures straight . re : j. czecholinski wow , j czecholinski 's perverting of the scripture is uncanny . somehow , he has gotten this vision and received a new gospel along with lahaye and jenkins . most of his words are empty , his verses taken out of context , the use of visions in revelation taken literal , and his best response is this : `` this thought process has dominated rapture writings for the past 25 years . '' wow , 25 years ! forgot about centuries of beliefs that the disciples have passed down and jesus 's own words and the scriptures ( again i point to the verses you brought up 1st thessalonians 4:16-17 - loud command and trumpet call of god ! ! ! ) . and then he tries to debate the baptism issue which jesus and the disciples have passed down , but in the last 100 years new thinkers have changed that to just `` pray jesus into your heart '' , although there are many verses about baptism being essential and zero about praying jesus into your heart ( big one being said by peter , a disciple of jesus in acts 2:38 `` peter replied , `` repent and be baptized , every one of you , in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins . and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit . '' then there is : matt 3:11 , john 3 ( water and spirit ! ) , acts 2:41 , acts 8:12-16 , acts 8:36-38 , acts 9:18 , acts 19:3-5 , acts 22:16 , romans 6 , 1 corinthians 12:13 , 1 corinthians 15:29 , galatians 3:27 , ephesians 4:5 , colossians 2:12 , and the list goes on and on although the bible never says to pray him into your heart ! i think the disciple peter said it best in 1st peter 3:18-22 `` for christ died for sins once for all , the righteous for the unrighteous , to bring you to god . he was put to death in the body but made alive by the spirit , through whom also he went and preached to the spirits in prison who disobeyed long ago when god waited patiently in the days of noah while the ark was being built . in it only a few people , eight in all , were saved through water , and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also -- not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward god . it saves you by the resurrection of jesus christ , who has gone into heaven and is at god 's right hand -- with angels , authorities and powers in submission to him . '' do n't try to say that baptism is a good work and compare it to ephesians 2:8 and take it out of context . salvation requires : believe , confess , repent , baptism , and living by your faith . that is the belief that jesus and the apostles have passed down for 2000 years . so j , you can go ahead and listen to thought of the last 25 to 100 years by man , but as for me , i will listen to the scriptures and to jesus and to paul and the apostles . for paul says in galatians 1:12 `` i did not receive it from any man , nor was i taught it ; rather , i received it by revelation from jesus christ .

"etienne": [{"num": 85, "context": "a complex tale of labor and strife , told with efficiency after `` l'assommoir '' and `` nana , '' i was accustomed to zola 's `` naturalist '' style of reporting the details and constructing a story to make a point about second empire society . but `` germinal '' surpasses those two , mainly due to zola 's efficiency . middle-class readers in his day were likely to have invested more time than contemporary readers in reading ( no search engines or video games in the late 19th century ) , so it 's understandable why `` germinal '' is so saturated with detail . that being noted , this is a masterfully written and passionate book that makes for fast reading . zola is at his best evoking the coal elevator , the movements of an enraged crowd , the gossiping wives of miners , etc. , giving the reader a clear description of the sights , sounds and smells of the moment . a few reviewers have interpreted this is a tale of oppresive capitalism . while much of symbolism ( the mine that eats the workers , the sufferings of catherine and so on ) could give that impression , this is story of disasterous ideology . set in 1866-1867 , when the civil war in the u.s. exacerbated the coal industry 's overcapitalization in france , etienne falls in love with the proto-socialist movement ( instead of catherine ) and sets off catastrophe . the episode in which etienne , chaval and catherine wait underground for their rescuers is a potent metaphor for his relationship with the miners . there are a number of very interesting characters in this book , who evolve to the decaying situations around them and often end up doing some very shocking things . sprinkled with references to darwin , `` germinal '' features multiple characters that seems to revert to animal-like behavior . whether zola was not into economic progress as some suggest here is debatable , but there can be no mistake that he wanted to show the tremendous sacrifices that are involved . the change to the timbering rules by the company , the charge by the miners to jean-bart , and the act of sabotage by the souvarine all have their disasterous unintended consequences . and it has been unintended consequences that defeated marxism . in this way zola was prophetic . chaval is mostly portrayed as a cruel man who represents the natural urges that etienne constantly battles . a very good website by a professor at washington state mentioned that `` chaval '' resembles `` cheval , '' which means `` horse . '' so the practicality , beast-of-the-mines existence of chaval is linked by name to the very sympathetic horses in this story . in this way chaval is a fully-developed character in `` germinal . '' does this book have contemporary interpretations ? during the week that i read this , there were two newspaper stories about coal mining . one in the weekend milwaukee paper , told of a labor shortage in american coal mines , where in pennsylvania and ohio , veteran miners are returning to the towns they once had to leave . soon afterward , the n.y. times described a tragic collapse in a coal mine in the central henan province of china , showing a picture of thin , grey-clad family members crowding a building next to the entrance to the mine , waiting for names of the survivors and the still missing . given the ( capitalist ) history of the u.s. and the ( communist ) history of china , would zola be surprised by the content of these two newspaper stories in 2004 ? coal mining in the u.s. , of course , is a segment of the economy of which many environmentalists disapprove ; its fate may be decided by the upcoming presidential election . zola 's `` germinal '' is a masterpiece ( i enjoyed the translation by leonard tanock ) , but its lessons may not be as simple as some readers may hope ."}], "loglimi": [{"num": 180, "context": "lindskold is back on track in the fourth installment in jane lindskold 's ongoing wolf series , the heroine firekeeper , her sentient wolf companuion blind seer , and her friend derian carter have all been kidnapped and taken to a nation called loglimi well south of the locales of their previous adventures . the loglimish are aware of the intelligence of the 'royal beasts ' firekeeper was raised by , and the creatures play an important part in their religion ; so the prospect of being able to establish through firekeeper better communication with the wise beasts is enticing and , at the same time , potentially threatening to many loglimi . as in the opener of the series , firekeeper 's entry into the court , or in this case temple , produces considerable friction . firekeeper is soon busy investigating the strange relationship between the loglimi and their animals ; at the same time ( and the reader may have to stretch a bit to accept this development ) she learns more of her own background . and there are , of course , nefarious plots underway which require the unique talents of firekeeper , blind seer , and derian to defeat them . no time is wasted in setting up the story ; the capture takes place before the first page . as a result , the other continuing characters from the series are n't present at all . but the removal to a new location avoids the feeling of staleness that crept into the previous volume . that makes this the best book in this series since the first"}], "egoless": [{"num": 192, "context": "the book of wisdom for the ages maha means great and yoga means a path of reunion . here the great path is outlined and explained in a truly timeless and masterful way . written by a direct disciple of the great ramana maharshi , this is a very important guide book for the seeker of ultimate reality . first published in 1937 , with numerous printings since then , this book is as fresh and new as a perfect spring morning . chapters include the sage , the world , god , the quest , the egoless state , and much more . for the modern day nondualist seeker , this is a treasure chest of spiritual wisdom . the author declares that we all , consciously or unconsciously , are always looking for the supreme beatitude of the egoless state , i.e. , direct knowledge of the one , the self . to quote a bit from the book : & quot ; the right thing to do is not to go on framing questions and seeking answers ... but to arrest the culprit , the ego , put him in the dock , and dispose of him by the quest of the real self , which he pretends to be . in other words , one should discover the real self , who is the final answer to all questions . every question that arises is vitiated by the ignorance which takes the ego at its face value , as the real self . all questions are therefore reducible to one , 'who am i ?

'' it was only about a foot-and-a-half high and could change color like a chameleon . the hoobat kills and eats the first creature , and then the hunt is on for others of its kind . even with the source of the sleeping sickness discovered , the 'solar queen 's ' young apprentices must still convince the rest of the galaxy that they are not a plague ship -- and therefore eligible to be destroyed on sight without warning . the 'solar queen ' novels are prime representatives of norton 's lean action-packed brand of story-telling ( at least the ones she solo-authored . ) if you have n't read them since you were a teen-ager , i urge you to try them again . for a few pleasant hours , you will be immersed in the adventures of a likeable , feisty band of free traders on exotic , carefully-drawn alien worlds ."}], "corporatized": [{"num": 239, "context": "what 's beneath your syntactic interface ? maggie balistreri 's critique of our masked , substantively evasive dialect offers humorous , albeit troubling , insight into how much of the social fabric , the prevailing belief structures and cultural processes , are entrenched in mass denial , subsisting on and predicated upon the avoidance of truth and meaning within common , everday conversations and exchanges . think of it as speaking in riddles . unfortunately , it 's done considerable damage in shaping the broader public discourse . this particular deficiency is widely adhered to on an unconscious level , to the extent that it 's accepted as 'normal ' . let 's suppose that the majority of a population shared a common mental illness , a soul sickness ; is n't it possible , even likely , that over time , a greater percentage of them would be unable to acknowledge the disease ... *as a disease ? * and by that postulation , would n't the afflicted then in turn deem those not likewise effected by it as the ones who are sick , weird , bad , wrong , etc ? with people generally unaware of this process ( and likely uninterested in it ) they are incapable of acknowledging how cognition and grammer are fused in a manner indicative of a deficient , or at least insufficient , mode of consciousness and expression which is congrous to self deception , mass deception , and in turn , self and societal censorship . this elaborate process largely stems from the `` just do it '' corporatized mentality . the underlying , strategic message of `` just do it '' is do n't think . that is , do n't think beyond the superficialities of life : of a mindless , wage slave existence relegated to the various conformities of rampant consumerism , and all it entails to define human worth and `` success '' on such terms . when people do n't think beyond those terms , when the customary , daily round of life is beset with a deluge of incentives and inducements toward desensitization and immediate gratification rooted in the manipulation and exploitation of innate human insecurities , often through induced signals and social cues concerning inadequacy , fear , anxiety , the result is an unthinking , non critical , homogeneous conformity among the populace where the surrender or denial of critical thought , genuine expression and emotional respression is widely encouraged , enabling an overall acceptance and exaltation of a unique spiritual and intellectual paralysis . logically it follows that since most are environmentally impacted and absorbed into this deficiency , its symptoms and manifestations are largely viewed as the opposite of what they really are , allowing for a delusional , happy consciousness . language reflects this . my take on what maggie is addressing in her book is n't a random social trend , and that there is n't necessarily a direct correlation with this dilemma and a person 's overall intelligence or vocabulary ; it 's an inevitable byproduct of poisonous , corporatized values . the proof is how corporate power , which is basically the hierarchy of government , so obviously benefits in every way from the crisis of social and spiritual declivity . the greater the degree of ignorance , apathy , and general disharmony , the greater profits to be made from human misery , and the more draconian measures that can be implemented by exploiting the symptoms which then serves to frighten people into being less independent minded and more stupified , perpetuating the cycle . the psychological dynamics of these cycles are fairly simple to figure out provided people are encouraged to do so . if they 're not sufficiently roused into paying attention to matters of great public import ( something that the media should do but of course does just the opposite ) than naturally , the people 's language and efforts of communication are going to reflect a particularly narrow mindset . `` loyalty to petrified opinion never broke a chain or freed a human soul '' ~ mark twai"}, {"num": 1033, "context": "violates the false claims act wow . i was shocked . legitimate statements of liberal christianity include ones like , 'transubstantiation is mistaken ' , 'the vatican does not have a direct pipeline to god ' , 'homosexuality is not a sin ' , 'condoms and birth control are morally defensible ' , not 'jesus never performed miracles ' , 'the trinity does not exist ' , 'jesus is not the son of god .

t help that he had a few doubts of his own ; that in spite of not finding any & quot ; smoking guns & quot ; in terms of banned weapons , he still sensed that iraq was playing a cat-and-mouse game . either the regime 's odd narcissism allowed it to believe that it did not have to comply with the un , or it was hiding something . either way , blix 's hesitation was enough to set the stage for colin powell 's historic february 5 , 2003 presentation of evidence of wmd ? s in iraq , which was more or less the proverbial point of no return . apparently , what mr. blix was trying to tell us -- before he was drowned out by the noisy din of a fearful and overzealous media -- is now common knowledge about wmd ? s in iraq : blix 's commission failed to find anything not because the iraqis succeeded at hiding the weapons , moving them ahead of inspections , but because the weapons really weren ? t there . iraq had disarmed at the end of the gulf war in 1991 , just as they ? d claimed . the un inspection program had worked -- without knowing it . so how did the war move forward under false pretenses ? according to blix , & quot ; a deficit of critical thinking & quot ; was to blame . he speculates that our congress would never affirm the use of force merely to end a reign of terror ( even though blix himself wishes for a un resolution against brutal dictatorships ) . the bush administration had to justify war in iraq by linking it to terror , and since there was no real link , it had to capitalize on the & quot ; theoretical & quot ; link of iraq 's weapons of mass destruction . this is as far as his speculation goes . where the phrase & quot ; military industrial complex & quot ; would seem most natural and expected -- followed by a salacious tell-all about bush , cheney and nefarious links to saudi oil -- blix cleverly sidesteps the issue of america 's impatient itch for war by feigning ignorance . giving blix the benefit of the doubt , perhaps he prefers to be thought of as naive and not sensational . needless to say , dr. david kelly 's death ( the british scientist who leaked to the bbc that the british government had & quot ; sexed up & quot ; a document alleging iraq 's nuclear capabilities ) was an & quot ; unfortunate suicide & quot ; -- and not the work of a shadow government . ( the entire document , by the way , turned out to be a forgery . ) at least blix observed the & quot ; horse trading & quot ; ( & quot ; intense economic and diplomatic pressures & quot ; ) our government used to obtain votes from other countries -- votes needed to pass the un resolution authorizing the use of force -- as well as he disapproved the bush administration ? s spying on un delegations while on their diplomatic visits to new york . blix had other objections to u.s.-led efforts , but they are all based on facts and evidence , and are in defense of iaea ( a previous inspection organization , also headed by blix ) and unmovic ( the un 's monitoring , verification , and inspection commission ) . interestingly , the largest setback to diplomacy was related to a 167-page & quot ; cluster & quot ; document released by blix in early march of 2003 , which summarized all the inspections for the three preceding months . unfortunately for france and germany , american and british members of unmovic leaked pre-release draft copies of the document . in other words , france and germany had much less time to prepare their official reactions to the cluster document than their british and american counterparts . their positions , in favor of renewed inspections , were not as compelling . while blix ? s passion is definitely enough to carry his memoirs , one can easily see why it was so difficult for americans to take mr. blix seriously : he lacks that forcible personality that commands respect . even so , he is gifted with an even temperament , a good sense of humor , and a deeply-imbued sense of integrity , all important qualities for diplomacy . although he may have been the only individual capable of peaceably bridging the large gap between the un and iraq , in retrospect it may have been asking too much from some of our leaders to match blix ? s diplomatic efforts in their reasonableness and patience"}, {"num": 1114, "context": "another great indian con being lapped up by the world ... let me start by explaining the title of my review : being an indian ( settled in india , not outside ) i am incessantly perplexed by the plethora or completely rubbish books from india which the west just ca n't seem to get enough of . books which say nothing about india , and are not about it . just books set in india , which throw in some curry and some local language , and somehow thus make people fall all over themselves in an attempt to praise the book . my gut revolts against such partisanship , and this is one of those books which is a perfect example of this rubbish trend , and hence is going to get such deserving treatment at my hands . but let me start by going back a bit in time and giving credit where it 's due : after reading his first two books , i came to the very early conclusion that vikram chandra was the narrator 's narrator , a storyteller of uncommon brilliance , a weaver of magic tales . on the flip side , like most other chandra fans , i too was frustrated by his ability to end every one of his stories in the worst all of all possible ways ; but i loved his craft nonetheless . i had almost convinced myself that with his next book , i 'd stop about 10 % before the end of the book , and with sacred games , that promise turned out to be very easy to fulfill - i managed to put the book down without dying of guilt about halfway through itself . sacred games is a book about nothing : there are no characters who feel real , it is not about the protagonists ' environment , it does n't rotate around or shed new light on any events , and it does n't deal with any objects of fascination . nothing . nil . zilch . nada . a lot of people have talked about this as another of the , if not the definitive bombay book , but having lived there myself , i can vouch for the fact that this book does n't even begin to capture an iota of the character or the essence of bombay .

' i suppose if one considers logic 101 tinged with the usual fundamentalist `defender of the faith ' rhetoric and aura ( which hovers over every page ) , then this could be called `scholarly . ' the big problem i found is that even when groothuis offers defensible criticisms , his alternatives end up being just as problematic as the positions he criticizes . for all his advocacy for a correspondence theory of truth , his tone betrays a penchant for certainty and formal coherence . he falls into the problem of the relation between thought and `reality , ' representation to presentation , the role of language , and so forth . no doubt god comes to save the day with all these problems , yet on the very justificatory terms groothuis advocates for , god escapes the measure of correspondence and becomes its condition of possibility . in other words , god becomes a structural metaphysical function which `saves ' groothuis 's truth from the skeptic . the problem , however , is that groothuis wants truth to be absolute , universal , and accessible to all , yet he is dependent on a moment ( i.e . faith ) which , by definition , retains a trace of contingency or `objective ' undecidability . groothuis 's more ethical concerns are where i am more sympathetic , but again , here his polemics and non-reading of the people he criticizes drowned out whatever constructive points he offers . groothuis practices the same type of irresponsible reflection that some of the `pomo ' evangelical 's do : uncriticality . here , philosophy and reflection - whether modern or postmodern - becomes a means to simply confirm and justify a complacent status quo , rather than challenging and transforming the status quo . the challenge presented in this book is for a nostalgic return to the good old days of christendom . jesus did not come to `save ' our metaphysical systems , but to redeem us and this world . that redemption is not contingent upon accurate representations as groothuis seems to think . it is madness to the greek ( i.e . the logician ) and a stumbling block to the legalist ( i.e . moralistic hypocrites ) . the task is not to make the faith less crazy or more socially repressive . as james tells us , the measure of `true ' faith - and here i will grant a type of reference - is that we `attend to the widow and orphan . ' kerygma without service is dead , a worse lie than any humanism . perhaps if we began `proving ' our faith , that is , manifesting its truth in radical service and justice - we could actually demonstrate the truth to which we testify . i guess it is much easier to `defend the faith ' with bad arguments which only convince the already convinced , than to `live the faith ' : serve the people no one gives a hoot about . after all , in the latter case one can not fancy oneself a hero in quite the same way ."}], "wotsq": [{"num": 436, "context": "interesting start to a new drow trilogy sacrifice of the widow by lisa smedman is the first book in the lady penitent trilogy . for fans of the forgotten realms , this book follows up on the events of the six book series war of the spider queen . so , before i start this review , if you have yet to read the war of the spider queen series , i strongly suggest you do before you read this as events from that series are talked about , and have consequences , in this book . if you choose to read this book , and most likely this trilogy , without reading wotsq then there may be some things that just do n't make sense - so consider yourself warned . the plot of this book is not your traditional plot , in that it is not really one linear plot with a few sub-plots sprinkled in . the sub-plots are very good and hint at much larger ramification that will more than likely transpire in the next two books . there is the sub-plot of what really happened to hallisstra melarn at the end of the sixth wotsq book , and how she became what she is now . there is a sub-plot of the followers of eilstraee fighting followers of tow other entities . there is also a sub-plot of a larger `battle ' between lolth and eilstraee . ms. smedman does a wonderful to weave all these sub-plots together to create not only an engaging story , but a seamless one at that . when the sub-plots shift between one another there is not much transition that throws the pace of the book off at all . the overall plot is very well written and easy to follow . there are several characters in this book . this is both a good thing and a bad thing at the same time . with all the different sub-plots there needed to be many characters to keep everything going . however , with this amount of characters there is less time for them to be developed fully so the reader has a better connection with them . there are a few characters that i would have definitely liked to read more about , and maybe that will be remedied in the next two books . do n't get me wrong , there was some character development in this book , such as that of hallisstra , her brother q'arlynd both had significant development . yet , the majority of the characters had little development . i believe that was just a part that had to suffer due to how much the plots of this book needed to be explained . overall , i enjoyed this book quite a bit . this is not your traditional drow novel in that it 's not strictly about subterfuge and chaos . the pace of this book is very good and ms. smedman 's writing lends itself to be easily read . it 's very easy to read through one hundred pages and wonder where the time went . with some drow books , the authors try to make these huge grand flourishes of prose , yet in this book ms. smedman seems conserved and this creates an easy feel . if you are a fan of the forgotten realms and have read the wotsq series you will undoubtedly enjoy this book for the continuation of that storyline . if you are a fan of fantasy in general and know a little about the forgotten realms i still believe you will enjoy this novel , although some things may not make much sense to you . at any rate , if you are considering reading this , i have no qualms about recommending it . it 's a very nice addition to the forgotten realms universe ."}], "anjali": [{"num": 463, "context": "the best book i 've read this year be prepared to weep at the end but this novel is beautiful . writing is superb and the characters are not only believable but they stay with you long after you close the book . anjali is waiting for her husband , prakash , to pick her up after a trip to her parents . prakash does n't show and anjali faces a life-changing situation as a result . anjali divorces , remarries and has a son , amar . the story weaves their fragile lives with a past that comes into the present . chapters are short and moving ;

yet all the reviews i read missed one of the main points of the novel -- which is the main reason why it 's so interesting -- whether it 's a great heinlein novel or not . many have already commented on the various themes of the book , most of which will already be familiar to heinlein fans . the one that was new was the bigotry against the main character , an artificial and genetically enhanced human . it seems most readers found this reaction unlikely , although this theme pervades the entire work . one reviewer asserts that it 's even the primary idea of the whole book . another important theme is the revolt against authority which many heinlein readers will certainly know from his other books such as the moon is a harsh mistress , double star , citizen of the galaxy , stranger in a strange land , sixth column , revolt in 2100 , and others . the theme of the competent man also takes center stage in this book , another famous and familiar heinlein theme , although in this book it 's a competent , genetically enhanced female . however , all these interpretations , although true , miss one very important point . in heinlein 's novels , the world is often a very unstable and even dangerous place -- but there is always hope , and optimism that conditions will be better in the future . often the main characters in heinlein 's books are intimately involved in this struggle to overthrow oppressive governments -- and usually succeeding , thereby creating a better life for themselves . so no matter how precarious and dark life in the present might be , heinlein always had hope for the future and seemed confident that humans would throw off the yoke of oppression , establish a better society , and basically good would win out over evil . but in this novel , he appears to have at least partly , perhaps substantially , abandoned that hope in favor of a much darker , more dismal , and depressing future for humanity , at least on earth . better prospects can be found off-planet on several newly colonized worlds . the evidence for this is n't hard to find , but is scattered throughout the book in various narratives , and in conversations between friday and her boss , dr. baldwin . by the way , kettle belly baldwin has not appeared , to my knowledge , in another heinlein book since gulf , published in 1949 . however , all of the other characters are new . so one of the charms of the book is that one gets to meet a lot of new characters , making this book different from almost all of heinlein 's later output , and an old but memorable character is brought back to life in a new context . but getting back to my point , heinlein makes it clear the earth is economically and politically deteriorating , with most of the world now completely balkanized into hundreds of small , petty states , each with its own unpleasant idiosyncrasies . heinlein says most of these small states are faceless ciphers , with a few larger , powerful states remaining . the u.s. is no different , being divided into several smaller sovereign states , along with canada . but these smaller states are often co-belligerants or are at war with each other . it 's said that peace rarely lasts more than a month . in one coup that occurs in the chicago imperium by militant republicans , democrats are rounded up and executed -- including their children down to the age of 14 . another alarming idea is that the large international corporations , such as ibm or the shipstone corp. , are also participants and instigators of these wars , and sometimes wipe out entire cities , such as acapulco . these corporations are hard to fight , since they have no single geographical location , and in the book , the internationals seem to be winning over the real or geographically `` localized '' countries . these super corporations are completely ruthless and immoral and killing for hire and mass murder by them are common . heinlein holds out little hope the situation will ever improve -- he sees elected officials as venal and corrupt parasites feeding at the public trough and mouthing fatuous platitudes for consumption by an impotent and perhaps naive public -- a much darker and more cynical interpretation of politics than that portrayed in starship troopers , the moon is a harsh mistress , or double star , in which , if i remember correctly , one character remarks that politics is the only game a mature man can take any pleasure in . even con artists and grifters heinlein sees as more noble -- at least they 're hardworking independents who are n't on the dole and are trying to earn an `` honest '' living . : - ) government and personal corruption are also ubiquitous . the police are not to be trusted in the book , and disposing of them if possible is considered a good idea -- as long as one can get away with it , of course . for a client who is powerful and wealthy enough , even physicians can be made to arrange for a certain patient to `` die '' on the operating table . in fact , almost no one in any position of authority -- except friday 's boss , baldwin , seems to be trustworthy . in conversations with her boss , dr. baldwin , he tells friday she needs to get off planet because of what 's happening on earth and asks her how one can tell if a society is truly sick -- that being when normal conventions of politeness and manners have deteriorated into rudeness -- which the people now take as a sign of strength . in the book , the good people always seem to be on the run and are persecuted -- while the evil flourish unhindered . an epidemic of cholera or bubonic plague that could kill millions is predicted , possibly because of a conspiracy . but baldwin sees this as a social good since cities are so overpopulated and dysfunctional already that thinning out the population -- however it is achieved -- is a worthwhile goal . so overall , it seems a darker and more pessimistic future than anything heinlein had ever imagined up to this time . but one of heinlein 's strengths is his ability to create believable alternate realities -- which again comes through here -- however dark and depressing it might be . whether it 's one of his greatest books or not , i think it counts as an unusual and worthwhile heinlein book because of that"}, {"num": 969, "context": "indispensable for western gardeners it 's

would normally catch my attention early and have my sympathy from the start . further , it 's a commentary on the abuses of power wrought by corporations ( in this case , pharmaceutical ) that are more powerful than governments . again , a device that immediately evokes common interests with me , an unabashed liberal . unfortunately that 's where the book and i part ways . justin , the minor

culpability lies mostly with inaction and that movements can overcome abuses of power . good theme , but . . . the execution was poor . pages and pages devoted to characterization fell short when actions did n't meet the set-up . as well , justin 's investigation took him around the world to look at a paper trail , not the most interesting tools of the thriller game . but we , as well as the character , examined the words and trail meticulously to the point where it became a joke how quickly the volume would put me to sleep . justin is such a luddite that we , as the reader , are forced to learn about computers , emails , and the myriad electronic communication pathways along with the protagonist . . . lecarre would have been well-suited to find a heartless editor , because the plot that does exist is not much more substantial than what a novella would handle nicely . bureaucracy can be handled in a paragraph where the author wants the reader as frustrated as his bureaucrat protagonist , an interesting irony done uninterestingly . this is n't to say that lecarre is a poor writer - his sentence construction is strong and his mastery of the craft evident . i 'm going to try another of his novels just because i believe this was an aberration caused by an author with an axe to grind and no right way to do it . another problem was that he telegraphed the plot . the only one stupid enough not to see who was behind the murder and conspiracy was justin himself . while this can work , showing the reader what the protagonist ca n't see ( see fight club ) , in this case it 's just painful to have to slough through the machinations of bumbling intrigue with a dull and plodding man . in summary , i did n't care about characters and i lost interest in the plot and the

that the armenian political unit was created by a certain general of the army of another country on the land snatched from the iberians/moskhians ; this is in vol 5 of strabo , the loeb classical library edition in 1936 ; this is the area where the republic of armenia was created in 1918.i recently learned that its name was planned to be 'republic of erevan ' ( not armenia ) and the league of the nations promised to the government of kartu i.e . georgia that the creation of armenia in caucasia was a temporary measure-f.nansen from that league of the nations desired to create some footing somewhere in the world for refugees driven out from the balkans and that soon the league of the nations would move the republic of armenia and her armenian and other refugees-unwanted citizens of turkey-to the mediterranean.these facts are known from materials published by f. nansen available in english and some translated into russian now on the web.the creation of that republic and that of azerbaijan in 1918 in the area was the gross violation of the human rights of the indigeneous nation called by several names : the iberians , the moskhians , the kardi etc . r.heusen is absolutely right in telling readers that even before world war i , the armenians were a minority in what became the republic of armenia in 1918.after reading those truthful remarks it was a sad surprise to me to see on the next page `` a map of the historical armenia '' encompassing greater territory than the great britain.r.heusen wrote the former was 238,000 square miles against 228,000 square miles of the latter.the term armenian plateau is frequently used by the author.it is unwelcome as other names were usually used for that plateau.moses khorenatsi is discussed at several pages.it is over two centuries that he is widely denounced for being a fictitious author and therefore called pseudo-moses khorenatsi.i have thoroughly researched materials on that author in publications , in unpublished

'' ( 3 ) one of the great aspects of this book is that benedict 's main arguments hold true even to this day . although many of her examples may be a bit outdated from our modern perspective , her conclusions drawn from those examples are still valid . however , due to the time that it was written , 1944-6 , benedict was unable to study in japan . instead , she had to rely on articles already written about japan and interviews with japanese immigrants . in doing so , benedict is able to draw three major conclusions about the japanese : japanese society is hierarchically structured , but in such a way that allows class mobility ; that everyone has a debt , or & # 24681 ; ( on ) , they must repay to the world ; their particularistic society allows them to easily adapt to almost any situation . for example , benedict tells us that hierarchy is one of the key aspects of japanese society , so much so that they have `` what is called a `respect language . ' '' ( 47 ) this means that forms of speech are altered to reflect the status of the speaker compared to the listener . before the meiji restoration , the emperor was at the top of the hierarchy , followed by the shogun , daimyo , samurai , farmers , artisans , merchants and finally the outcasts . japan operated in this hierarchical order for hundreds of years and it worked very well . as a result of this , the japanese people learned that as long as they did not do anything outside this order `` they could trust their world . '' ( 70 ) it was a system which `` guaranteed security so long as one followed the rules . '' ( 73 ) although the meiji reform attempted , in part , to do away with these class distinctions , it was not terribly successful : samurai became powerful bureaucrats , merchants still became more and more wealthy , farmers were farmers , and the outcasts were still looked down upon - despite their emancipation . the same can be said even of today 's japan . the elite families such as mitsubishi and mitsui are still very powerful . due to their integral role in japan 's economy , they are able to sway diet members ' opinions their way . another unique aspect of japanese hierarchy , benedict tells us , is that it allows for class mobility . just because one is born a merchant 's son does not mean one has to always be a commoner . as merchants during the pre-meiji era became wealthier , they were able to marry into samurai families . in this way , the `` merchant 's descendants become samurai '' and the samurai family marries into more money . ( 72 ) although this still occurs today between wealthy and prestigious families , there is also another way to move up and gain social prestige . by studying hard and getting into the best schools , one can be sure of a secure future . if one graduates from tokyo university , it would be very difficult to not find a good job . in this manner , even a lowly farmer 's second son can be an important man . one point that should be made clear about the japanese hierarchy is that the american view of hierarchy is not quite correct . americans views it as a very rigid and controlling way of life - indeed it is . however , the authority that a father exerts on his family or a shogun over the nation is not dictatorial . the opinions and well-being of the entire group are taken into consideration before any decisions are made . `` the master of the house saddles himself with great difficulty '' if he acts purely according to his own will . ( 55 ) benedict 's second main observance of the japanese is their sense of & # 24681 ; , or indebtedness , and the need to repay it . the japanese believe , she tells us , that when a child is born , he is immediately indebted to the emperor and will never be able to repay even a one-ten-thousandth of it back . the child is also indebted to his parents . only after becoming one `` does he know how indebted he is to his own parents . '' ( 102 ) tied directly to this idea is virtue . in japan , repaying ones debts is a very important part of life . one must always be careful to remember & # 24681 ; to the emperor and the parents . therefore , it is considered a virtue when one works toward repaying any debts and as a burden to acquire more . this sense of repaying someone continues even now . it is evident in gift giving practices in which an employee gives a boss a new year 's present as a way of paying him back for employment . also , when a guest visits a family he will often bring & # 12362 ; & # 37202 ; ( sake ) or some other small present as repayment for burdening the family . a peculiar side-effect of & # 24681 ; is that people do not often help strangers in need . to do so would be to give that person & # 24681 ; they would likely not be able to repay . benedict 's final insight into the japanese culture is their ability to adapt to almost any situation . the most obvious example of this is their attitude toward the occupation . when the emperor announced the unconditional surrender of japan , the japanese considered it a natural course of events and `` accepted all that such a fact implied . '' ( 305 ) there are numerous stories of the politeness showed to american troops upon arrival in japan . even the fact that there were no resistance forces or sabotage attempts during the occupation is a strong testament to this ability . `` japan 's real strength , '' benedict says , `` lies in her ability to say ... , `that failed , ' '' and take a completely different path . ( 304 ) benedict then says japan `` could make herself indispensable in the commerce of the east , '' which could not be closer to the truth . ( 314 ) japan 's economy boomed after the reconstruction and made it the technological center of the world . of course , anyone could make such a prediction given the fact that japan was no longer allowed to have an army . all the money that had been poured into the military could now be directed elsewhere . overall , i believe the chrysanthemum and the sword accomplishes benedict 's goal of describing the fundamentals of japanese culture and is a great addition to the existing literature on japan . as i have previously stated , some of her examples are indeed old-fashioned ( i.e . the stern mother-in-law and the tale of hachiko ) and may appear irrelevant to the study of modern japan ; however , what she is able to draw from these examples is still applicable . we should consider that even though america today is much different than the america of the `40 's , the same sorts of principles are held today - this can also be said of modern japan"}], "enid": [{"num": 523, "context": "great story ; very depressing , but very well written . the corrections is the tale of the lambert family , a pretty standard late 20th century midwestern family . alfred lambert , the father , suffers from an array of old-age medical disorders . his wife , enid , lives in denial of his ( and her own ) problems and thrusts her frustration upon their now-grown children : chip , the failed academic turned new york screenwriter , denise , the sexually confused upscale cook in philadelphia and gary , the maritally frustrated investment banker in philly . the plot follows the three children 's lives as the fall apart , seemingly in sync with the collapse of alfred 's health . the story is driven by enid 's desire to have her three children return home for alfred 's `` last '' christmas . franzen does an amazing job of carefully winding the story together , introducing fun moments of `` aha !

3,700 years ago-build up a surplus in the good years that will cover the deficits of the bad years.this is the first statement of what economists call a countercyclical fiscal policy.keynes 's additional provision is that the budget be split into two categories-one of which would be a capital budget.the government could only run deficits in the provision of capital projects in public infrastructure ( building dams , reservoirs , water projects-irrigation networks , seaports , airports , public transportation projects , public schools , colleges and universities , public research laboratories , etc. , ) that would pay for themselves in the long run.nor was keynes an advocate of tax cuts in an economic downturn except for temporarily suspending the social security tax for workers only.keynes 's major policy recommendation was the maintenance of low interest rates combined with a central bank policy of eliminating loan availability for speculative undertakings (

its eroei ( energy return on energy invested ) and pollution are a problem . as the richer seams are exhausted , it may cease to be a useful energy source within only 2-3 decades . nuclear : electricity from existing nuclear plants is inexpensive , but only if direct costs are considered . when adding in plant construction , safety , reactor decommissioning , and waste storage - nuclear power is very expensive indeed . there are currently 442 reactors operating worldwide . france in the only country in europe still building them . only asia expects to expand significantly . only a

enough to remember them . they 've pretty much become historical , iconic figures , like the stoic-looking george washington on a dollar bill . it 's a bit of a sad reminder of the inexorable march of time , but what a great relief to know that this treasure chest of a book is around to keep their memories alive . the author got the idea for it in 1961 when he read that ty cobb had died . realizing that many of cobb 's contemporaries would soon suffer the same fate , he set out to meet as many of them as he could and record -- literally with a tape recorder -- their stories for posterity . twenty six of them are recounted here . some of these guys are hall-of-famers , some of them not even close , but all of them -- every single one -- had a load of interesting tidbits to share . baseball was a different game back then . america was a different place . the first great thing about the book is that you get at least several takes on the great ballplayers . one of the fellows , for example , playing detroit , talked about being a little nervous about cobb , whom they had all heard would sharpen his spikes . a detroit player , however , mentioned that cobb never sharpened his spikes . not that they did n't discourage the other team from thinking so . walter johnson had an arm like a bullwhip , but he was a nice enough guy and a friend of sam crawford . late in the game , if his team was ahead by enough runs , he 'd toss a meatball in to crawford and let him belt it . he never did that for cobb , though , who he hated . cobb could never figure out why crawford was able to hit him . honus wagner is recalled by many as the best of all of them , with great quickness , great hitting and great fielding . a couple of the fellows recall that you could usually count on bits of gravel to be flung at you along with the ball he had just scooped up . tommy leach described him as the best fielding third-baseman , shortstop , first-baseman and outfielder in the league -- he played all of them -- and since he won the batting title eight times between 1900 and 1911 you could n't really argue that he was n't the best hitter in the league , either . for some odd reason , there are n't that many memorable gems about the great babe ruth , although there are at least a few . harry hooper ( a guy i 'd never heard of and a hall-of-famer ) remembers ruth in the first year he came up with boston as a , `` big , overgrown , green pea . '' `` nineteen years old , poorly educated , only lightly brushed by the social veneer we call civilization , he was gradually transformed into the idol of american youth and the symbol of baseball the world over . . . if somebody had predicted that back on the boston red sox in 1914 , he would have been thrown into the lunatic asylum . '' along with these detailed sketches , including a ton of characters i have n't even mentioned -- germany schaeffer , rube waddell ( who did n't like to wear underwear ) , lefty o'doul , dazzy vance -- the book is also , naturally , loaded with baseball anecdotes . some of the more famous plays of the time , for example , are recounted in different ways and with different perceptions . take the `` bonehead '' merkle play . for those of you who do n't know , what happened was this . the giants were tied with the cubs for first place with one week to go in the season . in a game against each other , in the bottom of the ninth of a 1-1 game , the giants had men on first and third with two outs . merkle was on first . birdwell hit a single to center , mccormack scored from third , and merkle . . . ran to the clubhouse . without touching second . the cubs retrieved the ball from center field , evers tagged second , and the run did n't count . because of the crowd on the field the game had to be replayed on a later date . the giants lost it , and lost the pennant . from then on and forever more , fred merkle became `` bonehead '' merkle . but it 's actually a little more complicated than that . for one thing , merkle was only nineteen . it was the first game he 'd ever started for the giants . and running into the clubhouse when the game was over was something all the guys did -- whether touching second was necessary or not -- because of the crowd pouring onto the field after the ushers opened the gates at the end of the game . the players ran off to get away from them . and evers never did tag second base with the ball that was hit out to center because someone had heaved it into the left field stands . fred snodgrass does n't think he ever tagged second with any ball at all . the umpires were n't around to know this , though ; they had already left the field ! funny how the mists of history tend to simplify things . the detail in this book brings these stories back to life . and there are a ton of them recounted . along with all of this baseball lore , you get a pretty good glimpse of america a hundred years ago , too . people were more humble , but in general confident , and much more direct . it 's fascinating just to consider their nicknames : `` wee willie '' was the nickname for a short guy , `` specs '' was the guy who wore glasses , `` chief , '' ( at least two of them ) were american indians , and , `` dummy '' was the guy who was deaf and dumb . nobody meant anything by it ; nobody apparently took offense . stuff like these speaks volumes . here 's jimmy austin : `` . . . they did n't have clubhouses in most parks , especially not for the visiting team . we 'd get into uniform at the hotel and ride out to the ball park in a bus drawn by four horses . they used to call it a tally-ho in those days . we 'd sit on seats along the sides and ride , in uniform , to the ballpark and back . `` that ride was always a lot of fun . kids running alongside as we went past , and rotten tomatoes once in a while . always lots of excitement when the ball club rode by , you know .

: some might find the degree of detail too heavy and slowing . i usually start by describing some of the plot , but the story-lines are only about a third of this book 's considerable charm . so . . . the setting : this is an alternate history tale , as far as the setting goes . it takes place on earth , and more preciously in ( what is left of ) england . but , this earth had no ice age , it was struck by an object ( popularly believed to have been a meteor ) that caused the sundering ( the seas rose , the land was mostly submerged , cultures lost touch with one another , the climate changed drastically ) , and humans live side-by-side with mastodons , mammoths , glyptodonts , and other creatures that did not perish ( because there was no ice age ) . the result is an isolated england , that retains much of its past , but has culturally evolved away from what it is ( to us ) . the characters : i am not sure that i have ever read another book that is populated by this many quirky , interesting , amusing , well-developed characters . these are very realistic people , living in a surreal time . even their names are colorful , quirky , and interesting : dr. pinches , mrs. matchless , mr. threadneedle , tim christmas . the characters and the writing speak strongly of a dickensian influence , but is definitely also just plain jeffrey barlough 's . the plots : yes , i did say `` plots '' in the plural . there are three , distinct story-lines , that share some characters and the same setting and time period . the woes of ms. jane wastefield is what i would entitle one story-line , wherein a beautiful young woman receives a birthday present that terrifies her father to death and then haunts her every waking moment . how can she be rid of the fiendish thing ? ! who can help her ? everyone wants to , but no one seems to know how . will she succumb ? would defeat be as terrible as she fears ? and what about her pet monkey ? the wizarding notions would be a good title for the story-line about mr. threadneedle , his apprentice tim christmas , and whatever they are tinkering with out in the coach-house . can they make it work ? will everyone be shocked ? will anyone believe them , without seeing the finished product ? will mr. threadneedle find some peace and enjoyment , if he succeeds ? the secret of the will is what bothers another set of characters . when rich old joseph cargo died , he left most of his estate to his favorite nephew , but who is jerry squailes , and why does he get one-fourth of the money ? no one knows , and young frederick cargo , spurred on by his shrewish wife and aided by their elderly , honest attorney , mr. liffey , go on a mission to uncover the truth . will they like the truth , when and if they find it ? will that thing kill any of them before they do solve the mystery of jerry squailes , the unknown heir ? my take : this book is some of the best escapist reading i have ever found . the world described is so different ( but not ) and so replete with interesting characters , that it becomes a great place to retreat to . the writing is very detailed , with tremendous development of setting , characters , and the interweaving stories . it is truly a fascinating journey to take , and the ending ( s ) is not how hollywood or fairy tales would do it , with a panoply of happily-ever-after . however , it is also not depressing . this tale is just plain well done . the bottom line this is a very memorable experience that takes you to a different place and tells you an interesting tale about amusing

why , however , because i 'm not entirely certain what those expectations were . i had n't read the novel previously , but i thought i knew what it was about . as a result , i think i was expecting more drama than verne delivers , or perhaps i simply wanted the book to be more than it is . most likely i was conflating verne 's novel with other texts : movie adaptations of the novel itself , for instance , in which considerably more in the way of actual antagonism -- as opposed to the perils of nature itself -- occurs ; or hollow world stories , in which entire societies thrive on the inside of the earth 's crust beneath the rays of a sun that lies at the planet 's center . a journey to the center of the earth is neither of these things , of course , and if i underwent any disillusionment , it was purely of my own making . understood on its own terms , the novel is , at the very least , interesting , but , truthfully , not much happens . the narrator 's speculations ( as well as his fevered dreams during times of travail ) suggest a much wilder adventure than actually takes place . much of the action involves the trio of explorers stumbling around in caverns and tunnels , and much of the impediment takes the form of hunger , dehydration , or equipment loss . in fact , as best i can judge , they really do n't approach anywhere near the center of the earth , although they do travel quite a distance laterally before resurfacing . the real joy is the interactions between the characters , primarily the trio of protagonists : the young narrator , his scientist uncle , and their silent , idiosyncratic guide . the expedition leader is an archetypal nutty professor , whose words and actions seem nonsensical to those not privy to his thought processes ; his nephew , the narrator , alternates between sheer wonder at his surroundings , and sheer terror at the likelihood of spending the rest of his short life surrounded by them ; hans , the guide , says almost nothing but performs his duties in an exemplary manner , and insists on being paid weekly rather than all at once , even while under the earth ( a square deal , in his eyes ) . their interactions with each other , and with the variety of icelandic folk they encounter on their way to the volcano which is their means of ingress , are wittily and cleverly depicted . these character moments are the high point of the novel ; one wonders how much of their clever interplay originates with verne and how much is an invention of the translator ( who , in this edition , remains sadly anonymous ) . whether the novel 's tone in its english version is added or simply preserved in translation , full marks to whomever this perceptive soul is . though one reflexively considers jules verne a `` science fiction '' writer of a primitive sort , this is really more of an adventure tale and , taken as such , it is generally successful . the adventurers do n't explore a strange new world so much as become more intimately acquainted with the world they already know , but if the reader does n't go in expecting flights of pure fancy , the novel is rather satisfying . postscript : i should point out that this review refers to the signet classic mass market paperback edition of the novel , which features an afterword by michael dirda . knowing amazon , it 's possible that this review will surface under

helper on the way from prague ( deep south ) up to an isle named `` ruegen '' ( in the very north ) , in the middle of her long journey through a breaking down germany : she came down with me and , after one day in hospital , she stuffed me away into a children 's home ( in a town called `` wuppertal '' , west-germany ) - and left me to my fate . so she robbed me ( among others ) the experience of a childhood in the gdr , german democratic republic , `` wuppertal '' should be `` west-germany '' ( american sector ) , the isle of ruegen became russian sector , behind the `` iron curtain '' . so i did not learn anything about `` young pioneer meetings '' , socialism , communism , stasi ( the secret police ) or summer camps of young `` pioneers '' . in the western hemisphere i grew up , drinking pepsi coke , receiving american care packages , later on : listened to the beatles , noticed the students movement in 1968 , had no ulbrich or honecker , but chancellor willy brandt and helmut kohl . but i tried to find out the place , where the woman could live , who had born me in that dark year 1945 . after 40 years of persistent search , 1985 , before the berlin wall fell ( 1989 ) , i found out : she was living behind the `` iron curtain '' on the isle of ruegen . and i started to look at this lost childhood , which i did not enjoy : she showed me her photo album : summer beach near `` kap arkona '' at the north-point of the isle , snowy winters on hiddensee , flight ducks , cranes - but on the other hand coal heaps on washed-out sidewalks . color films ( orwo ) , books , trabi substitute parts : only hard to get . nevertheless , i wanted to make up for my life in the gdr - in 1990 when the berlin wall was fallen : a schools inspector on the island pointed into a corridor , filled with former stasi employees ( security police ) and informed me in this manner in an almost dumb `` cadre conversation '' , he unfortunately ( thanks to the `` reunification '' of east and west-germany ) would have to hide many people in the teaching profession now ( in hastiest kind ) . i should return please to west-germany , where i just had come from . the direction of my journey seemed to be absolutely atypically , out of character , and not recommendable . no `` ossi '' ( vs. `` wessi '' ) - no job . as a result my mother , noticing , that all her dreams collapsed , joined an acute epidemic disease at that time : she committed a so-called balance sheets suicide . i was deprived of the chance to become a `` zone child '' a second time . did i miss really much ? because the book of jana hensel has stimulated me to these thoughts - maybe her sometimes nostalgic `` ossi '' writings ( of course very different to my `` wessi '' -point of view ) are not as superficial , simple , banal , as i thought in the first moment ? compare her point of view .."}], "semitism": [{"num": 722, "context": "succeeds as a book , fails as a social stimulator one only need read the reviews of this book from both professional and amateur critics to see that , if gross 's purpose is to aid the reconciliation between jews and poles , he has utterly failed . unlike books dealing with heroes who surmounted prejudice to create miracles , this book stirs an old cauldron of hatred , freshening the pot . readers without a more complete history of both the jews and the poles are especially at risk . jan karski 's `` story of a secret state '' which was actually written during world war 2 and deals with the situation in a balanced and informed manner would be a good companion book to this . additional reading should include a comprehensive review of polish-jewish relations , beginning with the charters of sanctity responsible for so many jews living in poland in the first place . when jews were being blamed for the plague and slaughtered throughout europe , the poles opened their doors and gave them a homeland , where they thrived for many centuries . the lutheran armies of the swedish invasions brought anti-semitism . later , poland was divided by germany , russia ( with a german queen ) , and austria , an occupation which lasted for more than a century . these countries waged a cultural war on the occupied poles , determined to convert them to their own . the poland of ww2 had only been liberated for a few decades . the equivalent of ronald reagan 's era to today . many of the citizens were of german descent and actually aided the nazis in their fight against other poles , not only jews . and although the sickening atrocities recounted in this book are inexcusable , one must keep in mind that they were committed by people driven to collective madness by decades of oppression , poverty and terror . we 've seen similar episodes in recent years in the balkans and africa and elsewhere . even the israeli human rights organization b'tselem maintains a website decrying violations by hate-infected israelis today . poland has only regained her true national and cultural identity in the last two decades , after two hundred years of occupation . pope john paul 2 was emblematic of that spirit , and poland 's support for israel and attempts to honor her jewish heritage , embraced by her youth of today , are evidence that she has turned a corner and is nurturing the great ideals of her past . the poland that was once a mighty

'' now , i might understand making some snide remark about former prime minister yitzhak shamir , who after all was a former leader of the stern gang . one might even do the same for former prime minister menachim begin , who was a former leader of the irgun . but netanyahu ? once again , this is poor journalism . and by the way , you might want to see how often the author calls any arabs `` extremists . '' it is true that antisemitic propaganda and incitement in the arab world has reminded many israelis of similar propaganda and incitement in germany in the 1930s . and that has resulted in some analogies being made between arab antisemitism today and german antisemitism before and during world war two . huband makes fun of such analogies . i think he should have taken them seriously . more bad journalism . the author does take benjamin beit-hallahmi seriously , though . huband quotes him to explain that the arabs are `` innocent bystanders , '' and that the jews are visiting revenge on the arabs for european antisemitism ! this is total nonsense , of course . more bad journalism . now , does a `` one-state '' solution to the arab-israeli conflict make sense ? maybe so . israel exists in order to protect jewish rights and to provide a refuge for jews . it exists to provide a state where jews will speak hebrew natively , attend hebrew schools universities , have hebrew traditions , and so forth . it can do all that in a state which has a large non-jewish population . and israel , even with ten thousand square miles , would be rather small for a state which houses over five million jews . if jewish rights to life , liberty , property , and immigration are protected , a one-state solution may be best . besides , while many people say that another arab state is needed as well , i see no real need for one except as a mechanism to attack or destroy israel . the author agrees that a one-state solution is best . and i think he even acknowledges that israel is part of the middle east . but it seems to me that his reason for wanting a one-state solution is to demolish jewish rights rather than support them . and getting rid of human rights would be bad for everyone in the region . this book is a good one to avoid"}, {"num": 1727, "context": "great premise , unfulfilled , but not for lack of pages i read this after enjoying iles ' `` footprints of god '' quite a bit . this is his first work and thank goodness he has since learned to be more concise . the book is lengthy , and repeats itself quite a bit ( due , i assume to the length and complexity of the plot and characters ) . several characters could 've been cut out entirely - they were in long enough to kill and be killed , but did n't add anything to the story . intriguing characters , too - he could 've saved them for their own stories . after wanting to get to the end for the last 200 pages , i found the ending itself rushed . all loose ends were wrapped up very conveniently and in ways that did n't pay off for the investment of time required to get that far . there were some aggravating teases , too . when the israeli finally gets to confront the nazi for the question of `` why ?

of the bible , the next time you read genesis , pay attention to how god is referred to . sometimes he 's called `` god '' and sometimes he 's called `` the lord '' . the reason for this is that the original hebrew text uses two different names for god , and the translators were careful to preserve this . when the hebrew text uses `` elohim '' it is translated as `` god '' . when the hebrew text uses `` yahweh '' , it is translated as `` the lord '' . if you carefully read genesis , you 'll notice that when genesis refers to god as `` yahweh '' , he seems to be very different than when he is refered to as `` elohim '' . for example , elohim is invisible -- he never appears to anybody nor can he be seen by anybody -- but yahweh talks face-to-face with people all the time : with abram , to jacob , and to moses and the 40 elders . elohim seems remote and regimented , whereas yahweh comes across as mischevious and irrascible . this has prompted some to propose the so-called `` documentary hypothesis '' which posits that genesis was formed by editing together two or more different books , each book using a different word for god and each book presenting a different picture of who god was and what he was all about . the book of j is the hypothasized book which used 'yahweh '' as the name of god . scholars try to reconstruct this book by bringing together all of the passages in the first 5 books of the bible which refer to god as `` yahweh '' . the result is startling : the same stories you 've heard all your life ( the tower of babal , joseph going to egypt , abram bargaining with god over sodom and gomorrah ) , when read together like this , take on a whole different level of meaning . this book provides two things in one handy volume : it provides a reconstruction of the book of j , freshly translated by david rosenberg , and it also provides an extended commentary by harold bloom , who is certainly the best reader alive today , and who is uniquely qualified to serve

'' for morter they heated bitumen . notice how this translation brings out the parallelism between the tower of babal and human society : the tower is made out mud bricks bound by bitumen , and society is made out of people bound by language . but people are also just made out of mud -- recall the creation story where yahweh breathes the breath of life into mud . baking the mud into bricks is symbolic of the people making themselves hard , and using bitumen for morter is symbolic of them using language and government to organize themselves . rosenberg 's translation makes available to us many of the puns and wordplay which other english translations unfortunately lose . now , to review bloom 's commentary . scholarly types are fond of dising bloom for his tendency to be speculative , to use his imagination to illuminate the reading of the text . but what they are forgetting is that j is a bunch of stories , written for us to experience ! to use an parable of rorty 's , its like a surgion describing your wife as a bunch of tissues and organs vs. describing your wife as warm and loving , important person in your life . yes , `` warm and loving '' ar n't medical terms , but that does n't make them a bad description of your wife . also , the very greatest literature , such as j is , will admit of more than one reading , more than one interpretation , more than one point of view . bloom here does us excellent service by showing us his point of view on the text , telling us how the experience of reading the text impacts him . the author of j did n't write j just to chronicle some historical figures -- the author of j wrote j so that we could read it , and by reading it , become changed into new people . _this_ is the aspect of experiiencing j which bloom 's commentary helps along , and this is the aspect which critics of bloom 's commentary are missing the most"}, {"num": 79, "context": "how to behave and contribute in this knowledge base world . this book is first published in 1999 . right in the beginning , drucker defined management as not only business management , but management in all kinds of organization : government , university , hospital , army , non-profit organization , etc . the book is easy to read , just below 200 pages . the scope and content is much wider than how we think management usually is . it describes the certainties : collapsing birthrate , shift in performance , global competitiveness , etc , and of course , how it affects all kinds of organizations . it talks about information challenges , the knowledge worker and how one manage oneself in this new century . concepts like `` individuals will outlive their organization '' , `` how to defines one 's goal and contribution '' are all interesting topics and issues that everyone have to face , since , this is the realities . i highly recommend this book to anyone , not just ceo/executives , but those want to know more about oneself , how to behave and contribute in this knowledge base world"}, {"num": 84, "context": "behind every great woman ... imperial woman is the fictionalized biography of the great dowager empress tzu hsi , the real power behind the throne during the reins of the last four emperors of china . the story starts with her as a beautiful manchu teenager who , along with her cousin sakota , is picked for the emperor 's crop of concubines . through guile and ambition , tzu hsi bears the male heir to the emperor she comes to control . when the emperor dies young , tzu hsi makes sure she and sakota are named regents for the young child emperor . through keen intelligence , intrigue , and whatever other means necessary , tzu hsi holds the imperial throne through her son 's childhood . buck portrays a woman split between feelings of love for her family and what is the best for the empire , rather than what i gather is the historical feeling - that tzu hsi was some sort of evil spider spinning schemes from the center of her web in forbidden city . through all the machinations and years she is aided by jung lu , her former betrothed and the love of her life . the dowager empress has the ultimate power , but buck shows she is a servant of the opinions of her court advisors and in reality only rules the eunuchs and court ladies in the forbidden city . she is a relic of the past in a time of great change and cultural upheaval in china , when it is besieged by western nations and ideas . the infamous boxer rebellion is the beginning of the end for tzu hsi , and she loses her spirit and resolve after this defeat and the death of her beloved jung lu ."}, {"num": 85, "context": "a complex tale of labor and strife , told with efficiency after `` l'assommoir '' and `` nana , '' i was accustomed to zola 's `` naturalist '' style of reporting the details and constructing a story to make a point about second empire society . but `` germinal '' surpasses those two , mainly due to zola 's efficiency . middle-class readers in his day were likely to have invested more time than contemporary readers in reading ( no search engines or video games in the late 19th century ) , so it 's understandable why `` germinal '' is so saturated with detail . that being noted , this is a masterfully written and passionate book that makes for fast reading . zola is at his best evoking the coal elevator , the movements of an enraged crowd , the gossiping wives of miners , etc. , giving the reader a clear description of the sights , sounds and smells of the moment . a few reviewers have interpreted this is a tale of oppresive capitalism . while much of symbolism ( the mine that eats the workers , the sufferings of catherine and so on ) could give that impression , this is story of disasterous ideology . set in 1866-1867 , when the civil war in the u.s. exacerbated the coal industry 's overcapitalization in france , etienne falls in love with the proto-socialist movement ( instead of catherine ) and sets off catastrophe . the episode in which etienne , chaval and catherine wait underground for their rescuers is a potent metaphor for his relationship with the miners . there are a number of very interesting characters in this book , who evolve to the decaying situations around them and often end up doing some very shocking things . sprinkled with references to darwin , `` germinal '' features multiple characters that seems to revert to animal-like behavior . whether zola was not into economic progress as some suggest here is debatable , but there can be no mistake that he wanted to show the tremendous sacrifices that are involved . the change to the timbering rules by the company , the charge by the miners to jean-bart , and the act of sabotage by the souvarine all have their disasterous unintended consequences . and it has been unintended consequences that defeated marxism . in this way zola was prophetic . chaval is mostly portrayed as a cruel man who represents the natural urges that etienne constantly battles . a very good website by a professor at washington state mentioned that `` chaval '' resembles `` cheval , '' which means `` horse . '' so the practicality , beast-of-the-mines existence of chaval is linked by name to the very sympathetic horses in this story . in this way chaval is a fully-developed character in `` germinal . '' does this book have contemporary interpretations ? during the week that i read this , there were two newspaper stories about coal mining . one in the weekend milwaukee paper , told of a labor shortage in american coal mines , where in pennsylvania and ohio , veteran miners are returning to the towns they once had to leave . soon afterward , the n.y. times described a tragic collapse in a coal mine in the central henan province of china , showing a picture of thin , grey-clad family members crowding a building next to the entrance to the mine , waiting for names of the survivors and the still missing . given the ( capitalist ) history of the u.s. and the ( communist ) history of china , would zola be surprised by the content of these two newspaper stories in 2004 ? coal mining in the u.s. , of course , is a segment of the economy of which many environmentalists disapprove ; its fate may be decided by the upcoming presidential election . zola 's `` germinal '' is a masterpiece ( i enjoyed the translation by leonard tanock ) , but its lessons may not be as simple as some readers may hope ."}, {"num": 86, "context": "try this without sound or sub-titles yes , i have seen seventh seal many times , and it is , indeed , stark . the other night i watched the new criterion dvd i was gifted with the lights out , the sound off and volumes one and two of coil 's 'music to listen to in the dark ' popped in the stereo . i mean , once one has once seen seventh seal , there is nothing to the plot .

( with what was salt purchased from tortuga ? there was no cash available , and credit with fithian seems unlikely to have extended there . ) islands other than the fictional devon island ( e.g . tighlman island ) suddenly become important at the end of the book , and are referenced as `` the old rivals of patamoke . '' if they are old rivals , why did n't they appear before ? did this get cut out of the book ? my third concern is a very strange charge to levy against michener . as anyone who has seen the musical `` south pacific '' knows , michener is strongly opposed to racism . certainly in this book there are whites , blacks , and indians of the full range of character and talent . however , the book still seems to have a strange racist undertone that i ca n't shake from my mind . it comes from how michener ties his story together across the centuries . every janney is feckless ( except for the one who becomes a steed ) . every steed is enterprising , although not necessarily industrious . every turlock is craven . every cater is proud , even if this is expressed differently across the generations . every paxmore is upstanding , even the sad-sack pusey paxmore believes he is acting in an upstanding manor until he looks back on what he 's done . one steed even refuses to acknowledge her own grandchildren because they have turlock blood in them , and is praised by the author for doing so . i realize that michener was using a shorthand to help the reader keep characters straight across the centuries , but the result is rather too `` geneticist , '' arguing that genes determine destiny"}, {"num": 128, "context": "slotkin 's vision will change the way you think about america slotkin analyzes the popular texts of early american life -- & quot ; capitivity narratives & quot ; of women abducted by native americans , dime novels , etc. -- to show how early americans came to rationalize the gap between their religious ideology and the reality of the wilderness they were meant to transform into the & quot ; city on the hill. & quot ; his careful study of the documents seems almost academic at first , and is sometimes rough going , but when i let his argument sink in ( as a student in slotkin 's undergraduate class which used this book as its text ) , it profoundly and permanently transformed the way i saw american culture and history . this book is revelatory for anyone interested in & quot ; american studies , & quot ; the creation of our national mythology , and in what makes america america"}, {"num": 129, "context": "transcendental this is the 3rd & culminating text of jung 's cw trilogy on alchemy ( see cw11 psychology & alchemy & cw12 alchemical studies before reading this one ) . jung obviously devoted considerable time & effort into the study of alchemy -- because he perceived an amazing parallel with his theories/model of the psyche & the process of individuation . i think it amazed him that the alchemists intuitively evoked such general principles of transcendental alchemy prior to the development of western science -- indeed , they were simultaneously immersed in this development such that modern chemistry evolved from it . oddly , some are now advocating the use of chemicals ( drugs ) in lieu of psychology -- e.g . for schizophrenia . maybe the tail is wagging the horse ? of course , this is a difficult text . the alchemical series may be the most difficult of jung 's already difficult texts . but , as jung demonstrated himself , sometimes the way to learn is to just jump in feet first -- absorb as you can . eventually , the material will start to sink in -- subconsciously if not consciously . give it a whirl . this text also has some very interesting quotes : p. 82 `` there is something serious in every joke . p. 125 if one does not understand a person , one tends to regard him as a fool . p. 200 it seems as if christianity had been from the outset the religion of chronic squabbles , and even now it does everything in its power never to let the squabbles rest . remarkably enough , it never stops preaching the gospel of neighborly love . p. 376 the creative mystic was ever a cross for the church , but it is to him that we own what is best in humanity ...

* and by that postulation , would n't the afflicted then in turn deem those not likewise effected by it as the ones who are sick , weird , bad , wrong , etc ? with people generally unaware of this process ( and likely uninterested in it ) they are incapable of acknowledging how cognition and grammer are fused in a manner indicative of a deficient , or at least insufficient , mode of consciousness and expression which is congrous to self deception , mass deception , and in turn , self and societal censorship . this elaborate process largely stems from the `` just do it '' corporatized mentality . the underlying , strategic message of `` just do it '' is do n't think . that is , do n't think beyond the superficialities of life : of a mindless , wage slave existence relegated to the various conformities of rampant consumerism , and all it entails to define human worth and `` success '' on such terms . when people do n't think beyond those terms , when the customary , daily round of life is beset with a deluge of incentives and inducements toward desensitization and immediate gratification rooted in the manipulation and exploitation of innate human insecurities , often through induced signals and social cues concerning inadequacy , fear , anxiety , the result is an unthinking , non critical , homogeneous conformity among the populace where the surrender or denial of critical thought , genuine expression and emotional respression is widely encouraged , enabling an overall acceptance and exaltation of a unique spiritual and intellectual paralysis . logically it follows that since most are environmentally impacted and absorbed into this deficiency , its symptoms and manifestations are largely viewed as the opposite of what they really are , allowing for a delusional , happy consciousness . language reflects this . my take on what maggie is addressing in her book is n't a random social trend , and that there is n't necessarily a direct correlation with this dilemma and a person 's overall intelligence or vocabulary ; it 's an inevitable byproduct of poisonous , corporatized values . the proof is how corporate power , which is basically the hierarchy of government , so obviously benefits in every way from the crisis of social and spiritual declivity . the greater the degree of ignorance , apathy , and general disharmony , the greater profits to be made from human misery , and the more draconian measures that can be implemented by exploiting the symptoms which then serves to frighten people into being less independent minded and more stupified , perpetuating the cycle . the psychological dynamics of these cycles are fairly simple to figure out provided people are encouraged to do so . if they 're not sufficiently roused into paying attention to matters of great public import ( something that the media should do but of course does just the opposite ) than naturally , the people 's language and efforts of communication are going to reflect a particularly narrow mindset . `` loyalty to petrified opinion never broke a chain or freed a human soul '' ~ mark twai"}, {"num": 246, "context": "a giant among giants some books are optional . `` the worm ouroboros '' , by e. r. eddison , is not . it is more than just the birth of high fantasy writing as we know it . it is a tale that connects with imagination and wonder in a way that books today simply do n't do . when you read `` the worm ouroboros '' you 'll realize that modern writers produce stories , but they do n't tell stories . since the english language fails to provide me with adequate superlatives for this review , i 'll just have to present samples of eddison 's writing : `` but a great wonder of this chamber , and a marvel to behold , was how the capital of every one of the four-and-twenty pillars was hewn from a single precious stone , carved by the hand of some sculptor of long ago into the living form of a monster : here was a harpy with a screaming mouth , so wonderously cut in ochre-tinted jade it was a marvel to hear no scream from her : here in wine-yellow topaz a flying fire-drake : there a cockatrice made of a single ruby : there a star sapphire the colour of moonlight , cut for a cyclops , so that the rays of the star trembled from his single eye : leviathans , all hewn from faultless gems , thrice the bulk of a big man 's body , velvet-dark sapphires , crystolite , beryl , amethyst , and the yellow zircon that is like transparent gold .

my mouth waters already ! it 's hard to imagine any literary treat that can be enjoyed in small doses more pleasurable than this . i have spent over a year savouring these stories , reading them one by one , tasting his delightful choice of words , digesting his fascinating story-lines , and the warm satisfying afterglow that comes after a typical twist at the end . o. henry began writing short stories as a prison inmate , and he quickly fine tuned his skills behind the bars and developed into an excellent storyteller . born william sydney porter ( 1862-1910 ) , he produced 270 stories under the pseudonym o. henry . his stories are superbly outstanding in at least four ways , each illustrated with five of my personal favorites . firstly , his brilliant use of language . these stories were written in the first half of the twentieth century , and o. henry 's use of language easily surpasses that of most contemporary writers . not only does he have an extensive vocabulary , but his writing abounds with similes and metaphors that breathe sparkling life and depth into his stories , marred only by the occasional `` lordy '' . `` ulysses and the dogman '' is a fine example of his skills with a language , metaphorically portraying dog owners as victims of circe , in a hopeless enchantment to their leashed pets . also exemplary is `` madame bo-peep of the ranches '' where a ranch manager has a heart fenced by barbwire just like the ranch on which he lives , and yet the twist at the ending suggests that perhaps we were completely mistaken . `` a comedy in rubber '' uses wonderfully elevated language to farcically portray a class of people today known as ambulance chasers . and `` sisters of the golden circle '' revolves around the profound bond that exists between two married women who are strangers but yet sisters `` of the plain gold band . '' `` an unfinished story '' employs profound metaphors of angelic hosts to tell the tragic story of poor dulcie 's struggle for survival . secondly , his unique insight into the social conditions of his time . o. henry has a great understanding of the trials of the lower class , and he frequently pictures the lives of ordinary people of early twentieth century america with warm and sympathetic colours . his characters are frequently the overlooked : the struggling shop girl , the unsuccessful artist , the impoverished . admittedly , some of his images can be hard to comprehend for modern readers , and the distance that time has placed between us and o. henry 's beloved new york means that some of his verbal pictures will be harder to understand and identify with . but his genuine sympathy for the oppressed can not be missed . `` the gift of the magi '' is the signature o. henry story , probably his most famous tale which recounts a poor young couple who both give up a prized possession in order to purchase a gift for one another - but ironically a gift intended to complement the other 's prized possession that they have just given up . another story which display his ability to picture the social conditions of his time - but always with the trademark twist - is `` the pendulum '' , a wonderful portrait of the daily routines of an poor couple and the bursting anxiety of a married man , until the bubble bursts . `` the cop and the anthem '' was the first o. henry story i ever read , and humorously recounts the unsuccessful attempts of a man to get into jail for the winter - it remains vivid in my mind as a memorable favorite . `` the furnished room '' is a tragic and shocking story of suicide , depicting the depths of despair and desperation of the impoverished . thirdly , his warm humour . o. henry has an uncanny ability to portray the mundane and the ordinary in the most elevated language . frequently he pits two characters together in a remarkable way so that one outshines and complements the other . and on other occasions he crafts the most ingenious and humorous schemes for outwitting others . one of his most popular stories is `` the handbook of hymen '' , recounting the tale of two men in a winter cabin , one armed with the hilarious herkimer 's handbook of indispensable information . and then there is o. henry 's fictional character jeff peters , a man who comes with the most ingenious money-making schemes , two shining examples displayed in `` jeff peters as a personal magnet '' and `` the exact science of matrimony '' . `` let me feel your pulse '' pokes fun at doctors , while in `` next to reading matter '' an overly eloquent character wins the heart of a senora with streams of articulate talk about the mundane . fourthly , his ironic twist . one of the distinctive characteristics of o. henry 's short stories is the ironic twist at the end , which never fails to surprise and entertain , sometimes reversing the entire story line in a concluding one-liner . o. henry 's suspense and trademark ironic twist ensures that readers who have a good literary taste in short stories will not be disappointed . like the jeff peters stories , `` the love-philtre of ikey schoenstein '' also feature a brilliant scheme - but a scheme of romance - and the way it backfires is unforgettable . other delightful examples of ordinary stories with a glorious ironic twist include `` witches ' loaves '' and `` while the auto waits '' . the twist that comes at the end of `` the hypotheses of failure '' is so perplexing , that you 'll have to re-read the entire story after reading the ending - but completely delighted at the way in which o. henry has misled you . but perhaps one of o. henry 's best uses of the ironic twist comes in `` the last leaf '' , a warm and tragic tale describing how a dying artist proves as resilient as the last leaf on the wall outside , and through the self-less sacrifice of another . the wordsworth collection is superlative , because it contains more than 700 pages of literary gems . it consists of 100 stories , showcasing a wide range of o. henry 's short-story talents . a few popular favorites are missing , such as `` schools and schools '' , `` shearing the wolf '' , `` the green door '' , and `` the pimienta pancakes . '' but the reality is that nearly all o. henry 's stories feature his trademark ironic twist , as they do his warm humour , his unique insight into the social conditions of the time , and his brilliant use of language , and that every story in this collection is a literary delight worthy of inclusion . the inaccessibility of some references for modern readers does not prevent these stories from being always entertaining and enduring ! do n't pass up on these ! - godly gadfl"}, {"num": 324, "context": "boring but interesting . does that make sense ? the story is very boring . a middle class family has high aspirations for obtaining upper class status and this `class consciousness ' controls everything they think and do . despite their foolishness , one ca n't help but feel sorry for each character ( with the exception of the mother ) who continually finds failure and disappointment . the characters are not developed to the point that i usually enjoy , and there are quite a large number of characters . an interesting thing about the characters is , none of them are `good .

'' donna jo napoli 's trademark technique of fleshing out a fairytale is in fine display in `` the magic circle , '' her retelling of `` hansel and gretel '' . napoli 's stories often reveal motivations behind some of the action that takes place in the traditional fairytales , reasoning out some of the fantastic elements and explaining the behaviour of the familiar characters ; which usually results in the villain becoming more sympathetic and understandable . such is certainly the case in `` the magic circle '' , in which she explores the background of hansel and gretel 's wicked witch . the hunchback woman is known as the ugly one by all her neighbours , but has the gift of healing which she uses to aid pregnant women and sick people in her medieval europe community . she is the proud mother of a beautiful little girl called asa , and enjoys her simple life as midwife in her country cottage . but her friend bala has other ideas , getting her work with wealthy families and in researching demonic activity so that ugly one may earn some more money - with much of the proceeds going to bala of course . ugly one is unsure about extending her talents to exclude exorcisms , knowing the danger is extremely great , but as a devout christian and a healer she feels compelled to comply with bala 's wishes - surely god will aid her , and no harm will come to her if she places herself within a magic circle that will protect her from the demons ' tricks . after cleansing a little boy from a demon 's influence , ugly one knows that she has found her new calling in life . but once several years pass , her confidence in her own abilities grow and in a mistake that will haunt her forever , she is careless with the protective magic circle . what follows is an escalating series of events that has her transformed into a witch by the vengeful demons and tied to a stake by the terrified villagers . bartering with the demons for her daughter 's life , ugly one manages to use her newfound malevolent powers to escape and hide in the forest . in napoli 's book the term `witch ' is used in the traditional christian sense , not the new age one , so be prepared for a negative usage of the word ( personally i found it quite refreshing this way - evil witches are so rare these days ! ) however , it 's not so black and white , for though ugly one can no longer shed tears , bleed or sleep , has demons whispering in her ears and an appetite for children , she is determined to not give in to her weaknesses . living in isolation , she manages to keep the demons at bay - until she hears the voices of two lost children outside her home ... napoli 's story is poignant and thought-provoking , as she raises questions concerning the nature of evil , the will of god and the strength of the individual against temptation . like all her other books , her spin on a traditional folktale is fascinating and will change your perception of `` hansel and gretel '' forever . although her interpretation of the gingerbread house is a little weak and a revelation concerning bala is raised only to be ignored , `` the magic circle '' is an intriguing little book . the demons and magical rituals mentioned are all based in real biblical and occult study ( so you 'll learn something practical alongside the retold fairytale !

'' ( 3 ) one of the great aspects of this book is that benedict 's main arguments hold true even to this day . although many of her examples may be a bit outdated from our modern perspective , her conclusions drawn from those examples are still valid . however , due to the time that it was written , 1944-6 , benedict was unable to study in japan . instead , she had to rely on articles already written about japan and interviews with japanese immigrants . in doing so , benedict is able to draw three major conclusions about the japanese : japanese society is hierarchically structured , but in such a way that allows class mobility ; that everyone has a debt , or & # 24681 ; ( on ) , they must repay to the world ; their particularistic society allows them to easily adapt to almost any situation . for example , benedict tells us that hierarchy is one of the key aspects of japanese society , so much so that they have `` what is called a `respect language . ' '' ( 47 ) this means that forms of speech are altered to reflect the status of the speaker compared to the listener . before the meiji restoration , the emperor was at the top of the hierarchy , followed by the shogun , daimyo , samurai , farmers , artisans , merchants and finally the outcasts . japan operated in this hierarchical order for hundreds of years and it worked very well . as a result of this , the japanese people learned that as long as they did not do anything outside this order `` they could trust their world . '' ( 70 ) it was a system which `` guaranteed security so long as one followed the rules . '' ( 73 ) although the meiji reform attempted , in part , to do away with these class distinctions , it was not terribly successful : samurai became powerful bureaucrats , merchants still became more and more wealthy , farmers were farmers , and the outcasts were still looked down upon - despite their emancipation . the same can be said even of today 's japan . the elite families such as mitsubishi and mitsui are still very powerful . due to their integral role in japan 's economy , they are able to sway diet members ' opinions their way . another unique aspect of japanese hierarchy , benedict tells us , is that it allows for class mobility . just because one is born a merchant 's son does not mean one has to always be a commoner . as merchants during the pre-meiji era became wealthier , they were able to marry into samurai families . in this way , the `` merchant 's descendants become samurai '' and the samurai family marries into more money . ( 72 ) although this still occurs today between wealthy and prestigious families , there is also another way to move up and gain social prestige . by studying hard and getting into the best schools , one can be sure of a secure future . if one graduates from tokyo university , it would be very difficult to not find a good job . in this manner , even a lowly farmer 's second son can be an important man . one point that should be made clear about the japanese hierarchy is that the american view of hierarchy is not quite correct . americans views it as a very rigid and controlling way of life - indeed it is . however , the authority that a father exerts on his family or a shogun over the nation is not dictatorial . the opinions and well-being of the entire group are taken into consideration before any decisions are made . `` the master of the house saddles himself with great difficulty '' if he acts purely according to his own will . ( 55 ) benedict 's second main observance of the japanese is their sense of & # 24681 ; , or indebtedness , and the need to repay it . the japanese believe , she tells us , that when a child is born , he is immediately indebted to the emperor and will never be able to repay even a one-ten-thousandth of it back . the child is also indebted to his parents . only after becoming one `` does he know how indebted he is to his own parents . '' ( 102 ) tied directly to this idea is virtue . in japan , repaying ones debts is a very important part of life . one must always be careful to remember & # 24681 ; to the emperor and the parents . therefore , it is considered a virtue when one works toward repaying any debts and as a burden to acquire more . this sense of repaying someone continues even now . it is evident in gift giving practices in which an employee gives a boss a new year 's present as a way of paying him back for employment . also , when a guest visits a family he will often bring & # 12362 ; & # 37202 ; ( sake ) or some other small present as repayment for burdening the family . a peculiar side-effect of & # 24681 ; is that people do not often help strangers in need . to do so would be to give that person & # 24681 ; they would likely not be able to repay . benedict 's final insight into the japanese culture is their ability to adapt to almost any situation . the most obvious example of this is their attitude toward the occupation . when the emperor announced the unconditional surrender of japan , the japanese considered it a natural course of events and `` accepted all that such a fact implied .

'' joan druett 's book is not quite on the level of those two books- they are `` richer '' in their narrative drive and complexity- but `` in the wake of madness '' is still a good , solid `` read . '' the author points out that at the time of the mutiny on the whaleship `` sharon , '' people who were not on board the ship assumed that the south sea islanders who killed captain howes norris did so because they were `` cannibals '' and `` heathens . '' the people who had direct knowledge of the events preceding the mutiny did nothing to dispel this notion- to do so would have raised questions concerning their own active or passive complicity in norris 's actions and could have damaged the careers of some highly ambitious ships ' officers . it turns out that captain norris had , over a long period of time , systematically beaten and abused an 18 year old crew member ( and apparent fugitive slave ) named george babcock . a combination of floggings and backbreaking labor finally resulted in the death of babcock . worse still , it appears that norris knew , way before the final denouement , that his actions would result in babcock 's death . it was the result he was looking for . druett speculates on the motivation ( s ) : racism , anger/fear ( norris had had trouble keeping control over his crew on a prior voyage on a different ship ) , frustration ( the `` sharon '' was having very bad luck finding and catching whales ) , etc . of course , harsh discipline was nothing unusual on board ships at the time . but norris seems to have been especially brutal , even by 19th century standards . babcock at one point tried to get help from his fellow crewmembers , as he feared for his life . his mates did try to protect him , before finally yielding to the authority of the captain and his officers . why did the officers support the captain ? we have to remember that a captain was sovereign of his ship . going against his wishes could result in being branded a mutineer ... not exactly good for your career . in any event , it appears that the south sea islanders who killed captain norris were either similarly abused or felt that , given enough time , they would suffer the same fate as babcock . `` in the wake of madness '' works as both an adventure story- as mrs. druett describes the recapture of the `` sharon '' by her crew- and as something broader- as we learn a bit about the day-to-day operation of a whaling ship and of the cultural dynamics that came into play when new england whalers met pacific islanders . stopping off at the islands was a bit like playing `` russian roulette . '' on some islands , the natives were very friendly and would provide women and food for trade goods ( although they did have a propensity for stealing anything made of iron that was n't nailed down ) . on other islands you could run into cannibals or natives who would murder the crew and steal the ship . not infrequently , some crewmembers who felt misused would jump-ship at some friendly port-of-call and `` go native '' or try to `` sign-on '' with another whaling ship with a more easy-going captain . we also learn a little about life back home on martha 's vineyard . the book seems a bit abrupt and frantically paced , with mrs. druett attempting to juggle all this in only 230 pages . still , this is a generally well-written , interesting book , and worth your time"}, {"num": 529, "context": "one amazing adventure for a thief the story starts with an introduction to a somewhat cantankerous , yet highly amusing character , gen . he is stuck in jail , having been caught thieving . he bragged about the theft , which is what got him caught . he is taken from prison and told that the king wishes for him to steal something for him that many believe to only be a myth . gen 's only other option is death . so onward the journey goes . he travels with the magus and his two apprentices , ambiades and sophos , plus the admirable soldier , pol . gen is treated as a subservient fool and most times is thought of as nothing but a tool to enact the theft . this viewpoint lends a somewhat snide , yet funny and endearing perspective of the story . i enjoyed watching as the character dynamics changed throughout . plus , on their journey we are introduced to the legends of their gods through campfire stories , which i found a wonderful addition to the story . they added flavor to the history of the lands and gave us an understanding of how the people thought and why they did what they did . i thoroughly enjoyed reading this tale . yes , a worthy read indeed"}, {"num": 538, "context": "not that good i do n't mean not very good , i mean not as good as people say it is . i really do n't understand why people think zahn is so brilliant . zahn is an excellent storyteller , but honestly , he is n't a very good writer . the trilogy is plagued by gratuitous references back to events in the movies . `` luke reaches for his lightsaber , and recalls when he was hung upside down in a wampa cave on hoth and had to use the force to get his lightsaber from the snow .

business , and lore `the encyclopedia of food and wine in america ' is a great 1500 page compilation of excellently written articles on virtually every aspect of the history , education , manufacture , marketing , personalities , and writing about food in america . practically the only thing it does not include is recipes or cooking . even sidebars whose label suggests a proper place for a recipe such as the sidebar on shoofly pie gives not one hint about how to make this delicious dessert . given the size of the subject , it is not at all surprising that the editors have left these out , as both recipes and kitchen science can both be considered without nationality , plus the fact that there are thousands of good cookbooks and a score of books on food science available today , so why not focus on things which are not commonly covered in these books . this means that this volume can sit beside the `larousse gastronomique ' with only a very small amount of overlap in material . these two giant books have two entirely different objectives . while both works will have articles on potatoes , larousse will tell you how to cook them , but oxford will tell us were they are grown , their commercial importance , nutritional importance , and their appearance in cartoons . so , unlike larousse , you are much more inclined to simply read the articles in these volumes for your own entertainment as much as for your need to know something . the articles are filled to the brim with interesting trivia about american food . one favorite item in the article about spam is the fact that the word `spam ' became associated with junk e-mail on the strength of a monty python skit which did the same kind of number on spam as the movie `blazing saddles ' did on western films . another discovery was the renaming of sauerkraut to `liberty cabbage ' after world war i . in this way , the book follows the style of the encyclopedia britannica that leans heavily toward long , detailed articles rather than shorter articles with a greater chance of redundancy , especially with a hundred or more independent contributors . it would probably take the average foodie about five minutes of searching through these volumes to find something they miss . my first sense of something being missing was when there were articles about charlie trotter , alice waters , and rick bayless , but no articles on thomas keller , jeremiah tower , or richard olney . i would not feel the absence so acutely if the editors had given us biographies on julia child , james beard , craig claiborne , and m.f.k . fisher and stopped there , as all four of these figures are so obviously at the very top of the heap in their influence on american eating and food writing . on the other hand , tower and olney between them are probably as much an influence on culinary professionals in the united states as alice waters . while olney spent much of his life living in france , he was born in iowa and all of his most influential works , most notably his editorship of the time-life culinary series of books in the 1960s was aimed at american audiences . this series is mentioned twice in the long article on cookbooks with no mention of olney as the editor , a position recommended to the publishers by james beard . regarding keller and trotter , for example , both have received the james beard best chef in the country award and of the books attributed to these two chefs , i much prefer the two from keller than the three from trotter which i have reviewed . i suspect the difference in the eyes of the editors is trotter 's earlier ascendancy , his substantial charitable activities , and his better than average culinary instruction tv shows . these quibbles aside , i am genuinely impressed by the overall quality of the writing in the thousands of articles in this work . the biographical articles all begin with a crisp statement of the importance of the subject to american culinary history . in spite of the very large number of writers , all articles seem to share this same matter of factness , with virtually no sentimentality or sensationalism . one joggling act that must have challanged the editors is how to limit the book to `american ' subjects . and , they seem to have accomplished this with great good judgment . in place of any mention of french or italian or japanese or korean or east indian or chinese subjects , the editors have given us articles on `italian-american ' food and `german-american ' food . i know the german-american culinary world better than any other and i give the author of this article high marks for capturing the big picture and not limiting himself to the very easy subject of the `pennsylvania dutch ' cuisine . although the amish and mennonite communities of pennsylvania , ohio , new york , and the carolinas are at the heart of the german / american food tradition , the greater german influence is much broader , overlapping , for example , the jewish-american culinary world and even the influences from france and italy . by far the best use for this work is as a starting point for serious culinary research or simply noodling around the literature of cookery for fun . in addition to the articles with their excellent bibliographies , there are appendices on general food bibliography , general wine bibliography , list of food periodicals and web sites , major food subject reference libraries , major food museums , food organizations , and food festivals . be warned that in spite of the title , wine gets much less than half the volume of ink spilled in these volumes . i also detected a few minor editing mistakes and omissions . the web site for the cable `food network ' is listed as www.foodtv.com , but this was changed close to two years ago to www.foodnetwork.com . this little mistake is less easy to understand since the article on julia child notes her death which occurred about 6 months ago . still , this book is a great source of entertainment and information for foodies and foodie scholars . expensive , but of high quality as a reference and entertainment ."}, {"num": 594, "context": "a missing link

touched upon . macyoung 's purpose here is a different one . `` hard '' arts generally teach practitioners to exchange blows at a certain distance . grappling arts show how to fight an opponent from a clinch or on the ground . authors like geoff thompson emphasize sizing up a potential attacker and resolving with pre-emptive strikes . what none of these address is how to handle the wild onrush of an attacker who has already initiated his assault and who is not going to stand back and trade blows . this book aims to make `` hard '' martial arts street effective not by re-explaining their existing techniques but by filling in certain gaps , principally by applying `` soft '' blocking and takedown concepts from wing chun and silat . karate/taekwondo practitioners may find this difficult to reconcile with their own styles - unless they subscribe to the opinion ( not addressed in this book ) that the `` hard '' arts once had a considerable `` soft '' content , and that movements like those now labelled `` blocks '' were originally something else altogether - but is a valuable and effective complement nevertheless . the book also includes good advice on the nature of violence and how to avoid it , and emphasizes `` winning while escaping '' . stylistically , macyoung 's easygoing tone and humour may or may not please , but behind it is a well written book which succeeds in communicating concept and technique in words . some sections can at first seem repetitive or difficult to follow ( not helped by the lack of clear labelling of photos - my one major gripe ) , but this

'the glorious cause ' is the second in shaara 's two volume piece historical fiction concerning the revolutionary war . 'rise to rebellion ' was the first , and i believe the superior of the two , but 'the glorious cause ' is an excellent novel as well . 'rise to rebellion ' was the superior of the two novels due to the changes of heart that the readers sees in john adams and benjamin franklin concerning the issue of independence from england .

difficulties of fighting a war with the governmental structures and restrictions that the contintenal congress was hampered with . in addition , more battles and fronts could have been explored , such

{"num": 630, "context": "a different sort of heinlein book after reading many of the reviews here , i note that opinion seems divided on whether it 's truly a good heinlein book or not . most still consider it a pretty fair heinlein yarn , and yet all the reviews i read missed one of the main points of the novel -- which is the main reason why it 's so interesting -- whether it 's a great heinlein novel or not . many have already commented on the various themes of the book , most of which will already be familiar to heinlein fans . the one that was new was the bigotry against the main character , an artificial and genetically enhanced human . it seems most readers found this reaction unlikely , although this theme pervades the entire work . one reviewer asserts that it 's even the primary idea of the whole book . another important theme is the revolt against authority which many heinlein readers will certainly know from his other books such as the moon is a harsh mistress , double star , citizen of the galaxy , stranger in a strange land , sixth column , revolt in 2100 , and others . the theme of the competent man also takes center stage in this book , another famous and familiar heinlein theme , although in this book it 's a competent , genetically enhanced female . however , all these interpretations , although true , miss one very important point . in heinlein 's novels , the world is often a very unstable and even dangerous place -- but there is always hope , and optimism that conditions will be better in the future . often the main characters in heinlein 's books are intimately involved in this struggle to overthrow oppressive governments -- and usually succeeding , thereby creating a better life for themselves . so no matter how precarious and dark life in the present might be , heinlein always had hope for the future and seemed confident that humans would throw off the yoke of oppression , establish a better society , and basically good would win out over evil . but in this novel , he appears to have at least partly , perhaps substantially , abandoned that hope in favor of a much darker , more dismal , and depressing future for humanity , at least on earth . better prospects can be found off-planet on several newly colonized worlds . the evidence for this is n't hard to find , but is scattered throughout the book in various narratives , and in conversations between friday and her boss , dr. baldwin . by the way , kettle belly baldwin has not appeared , to my knowledge , in another heinlein book since gulf , published in 1949 . however , all of the other characters are new . so one of the charms of the book is that one gets to meet a lot of new characters , making this book different from almost all of heinlein 's later output , and an old but memorable character is brought back to life in a new context . but getting back to my point , heinlein makes it clear the earth is economically and politically deteriorating , with most of the world now completely balkanized into hundreds of small , petty states , each with its own unpleasant idiosyncrasies . heinlein says most of these small states are faceless ciphers , with a few larger , powerful states remaining . the u.s. is no different , being divided into several smaller sovereign states , along with canada . but these smaller states are often co-belligerants or are at war with each other . it 's said that peace rarely lasts more than a month . in one coup that occurs in the chicago imperium by militant republicans , democrats are rounded up and executed -- including their children down to the age of 14 . another alarming idea is that the large international corporations , such as ibm or the shipstone corp. , are also participants and instigators of these wars , and sometimes wipe out entire cities , such as acapulco . these corporations are hard to fight , since they have no single geographical location , and in the book , the internationals seem to be winning over the real or geographically `` localized '' countries . these super corporations are completely ruthless and immoral and killing for hire and mass murder by them are common . heinlein holds out little hope the situation will ever improve -- he sees elected officials as venal and corrupt parasites feeding at the public trough and mouthing fatuous platitudes for consumption by an impotent and perhaps naive public -- a much darker and more cynical interpretation of politics than that portrayed in starship troopers , the moon is a harsh mistress , or double star , in which , if i remember correctly , one character remarks that politics is the only game a mature man can take any pleasure in . even con artists and grifters heinlein sees as more noble -- at least they 're hardworking independents who are n't on the dole and are trying to earn an `` honest '' living . : - ) government and personal corruption are also ubiquitous . the police are not to be trusted in the book , and disposing of them if possible is considered a good idea -- as long as one can get away with it , of course . for a client who is powerful and wealthy enough , even physicians can be made to arrange for a certain patient to `` die '' on the operating table . in fact , almost no one in any position of authority -- except friday 's boss , baldwin , seems to be trustworthy . in conversations with her boss , dr. baldwin , he tells friday she needs to get off planet because of what 's happening on earth and asks her how one can tell if a society is truly sick -- that being when normal conventions of politeness and manners have deteriorated into rudeness -- which the people now take as a sign of strength . in the book , the good people always seem to be on the run and are persecuted -- while the evil flourish unhindered . an epidemic of cholera or bubonic plague that could kill millions is predicted , possibly because of a conspiracy . but baldwin sees this as a social good since cities are so overpopulated and dysfunctional already that thinning out the population -- however it is achieved -- is a worthwhile goal . so overall , it seems a darker and more pessimistic future than anything heinlein had ever imagined up to this time . but one of heinlein 's strengths is his ability to create believable alternate realities -- which again comes through here -- however dark and depressing it might be . whether it 's one of his greatest books or not , i think it counts as an unusual and worthwhile heinlein book because of that"}, {"num": 633, "context": "well done book ,

gradually i started to read it more and more . i have spent the last week reading it non-stop , i just finished it about 20 minutes ago . anyways , this is a great book , i found it especially

natural gas : can not be shipped from overseas easily like oil - is more difficult to extract economically every year - is being depleted like oil . in view of the precarious status of north american gas supplies , any attempt to shift to ng as an intermediate fuel would waste time and capital in the enlargement of an infrastructure that will soon be obsolete . coal : shortage not so much a problem , however , its eroei ( energy return on energy invested ) and pollution are a problem . as the richer seams are exhausted , it may cease to be a useful energy source within only 2-3 decades . nuclear : electricity from existing nuclear plants is inexpensive , but only if direct costs are considered . when adding in plant construction , safety , reactor decommissioning , and waste storage - nuclear power is very expensive indeed . there are currently 442 reactors operating worldwide . france in the only country in europe still building them . only asia expects to expand significantly . only a few of the highly touted fast breeder reactors have been built , and they have proven to be prohibitively expensive . the us currently processes enough uranium to fuel existing us reactors for the next 40 years . the mining process is wasteful , polluting , and dangerous . when all things are considered , the eroei on nuclear energy is fairly low and there is significant intangible downside . wind : of all renewables ( not depletable ) , wind power usage on a global scale is being developed the fastest . technology has advanced - it no longer kills birds because it uses slower fan speeds and the fans are mounted on a vertical axis . it can operate in more variable wind speeds and the cost is declining rapidly . soon your own equipment could be bought and used on your own property . wind has the best eroei and germany leads the world in its usage . on a large scale , wind power would require vastly new infrastructure , but it is the most practical alternative so far . problem :

converted to fuel transportation and agricultural needs . hydrogen : for now , the process of hydrogen production always uses more energy than the resulting hydrogen will yield . for one thing , hydrogen is not an energy source , but an energy carrier . it 's production depends on continued usage of the dwindling supply of natural gas . there is new technology , however , and reason to be optimistic . as with wind and solar , a whole new infrastructure , requiring time and investments of huge amounts of money and energy technology are necessary . like wind and solar , hydrogen fuel cells should be central features of our plans to phase out petroleum . we should be dramatically increasing these investments . hydroelectric : in many regions of the world - and especially in the us - it is already thoroughly exploited . geothermal power , tides , and waves : limited application in limited regions of the world . biomass : wood burning - pollution and limited resources in a world

journey to the center of the earth did not turn out to be quite what i was expecting ; i ca n't say quite why , however , because i 'm not entirely certain what those expectations were . i had n't read the novel previously , but i thought i knew what it was about . as a result , i think i was expecting more drama than verne delivers , or perhaps i simply wanted the book to be more than it is . most likely i was conflating verne 's novel with other texts : movie adaptations of the novel itself , for instance , in which considerably more in the way of actual antagonism -- as opposed to the perils of nature itself -- occurs ; or hollow world stories , in which entire societies thrive on the inside of the earth 's crust beneath the rays of a sun that lies at the planet 's center . a journey to the center of the earth is neither of these things , of course , and if i underwent any disillusionment , it was purely of my own making . understood on its own terms , the novel is , at the very least , interesting , but , truthfully , not much happens . the narrator 's speculations ( as well as his fevered dreams during times of travail ) suggest a much wilder adventure than actually takes place . much of the action involves the trio of explorers stumbling around in caverns and tunnels , and much of the impediment takes the form of hunger , dehydration , or equipment loss . in fact , as best i can judge , they really do n't approach anywhere near the center of the earth , although they do travel quite a distance laterally before resurfacing . the real joy is the interactions between the characters , primarily the trio of protagonists : the young narrator , his scientist uncle , and their silent , idiosyncratic guide . the expedition leader is an archetypal nutty professor , whose words and actions seem nonsensical to those not privy to his thought processes ; his nephew , the narrator , alternates between sheer wonder at his surroundings , and sheer terror at the likelihood of spending the rest of his short life surrounded by them ; hans , the guide , says almost nothing but performs his duties in an exemplary manner , and insists on being paid weekly rather than all at once , even while under the earth ( a square deal , in his eyes ) . their interactions with each other , and with the variety of icelandic folk they encounter on their way to the volcano which is their means of ingress , are wittily and cleverly depicted . these character moments are the high point of the novel ; one wonders how much of their clever interplay originates with verne and how much is an invention of the translator ( who , in this edition , remains sadly anonymous ) . whether the novel 's tone in its english version is added or simply preserved in translation , full marks to whomever this perceptive soul is . though one reflexively considers jules verne a `` science fiction '' writer of a primitive sort , this is really more of an adventure tale and , taken as such , it is generally successful . the adventurers do n't explore a strange new world so much as become more intimately acquainted with the world they already know , but if the reader does n't go in expecting flights of pure fancy , the novel is rather satisfying . postscript : i should point out that this review refers to the signet classic mass market paperback edition of

'' this comment , paraphrased from philosopher jerry fodor , typifies what daniel dennett has been contending with for many years . although the `` cartesian theatre '' notion , that the body was one aspect of our being and the mind another - `` dualism '' - has supposedly been supplanted , it has not lost its hold on our view of consciousness . we continue to insist , in some form or other , that `` somebody , and it better be me '' is inside our minds looking out at the world . although we ca n't find that `` self '' in there , we have a hunch it 's there . when dennett wrote `` consciousness explained '' in 1991 , it seemed the `` homunculus '' representing our `` self '' had been laid to rest . this excellent collection of essays and lectures , is an update on that earlier work . as lectures , they have a conversational tone , yet impart many deep insights . addressing consciousness through four major themes , dennett shows us the project of eradicating `` dualism '' remains incomplete . until that view of `` self '' is discarded , our understanding of consciousness will remain misleading . the first theme he addresses is the `` zombie '' . philosophers have posed the idea that a duplicate person , identical to you in every way but one , is logically possible . the person would act as you act , talk as you do , have the same preferences and distastes . but it would not be conscious . this proposal presumes that something in you could be identified that is lacking in the zombie . for most of us , who still feel our `` self '' remains somehow separate within us , the logic seems reasonable . dennett carefully examines the implications of the proposal , and dismisses it as modernised dualism . if a region of the brain holds the key to `` self '' it remains out of sight and undetectable . perhaps the most challenging segment of the book deals with `` heterophenomonology '' . this tongue-twisting phrase refers to the methods used in cognitive science . because consciousness is `` often celebrated as a mystery beyond science '' dennett challenges researchers to take a step back from commonly accepted techniques . become a `` martian '' cognitive scientist to broaden the scope of the work . one facet of this approach relies on understanding what `` folk psychology '' is , then building from there . we prefer to believe that what we believe is entirely private and unaccessible . heterophenomonolgy , he contends , will expose aspects of our consciousness we view as a `` mystery '' . one of those `` mysteries '' has been wrapped in the idea of `` qualia '' . probably one of the poorest concepts in philosophy , `` qualia '' are things said to possess `` intrinsic qualities '' . when you carefully examine those `` intrinsic '' properties , they begin to fade and vanish . if `` qualia '' is in an object we see , such as colour , how can it change without our noticing ? tests of `` change blindness '' indicate we can miss much concerning `` qualia '' . even the philosophic community , dennett notes , can not agree on a definition of `` qualia '' . yet , like the homunculus in the mind viewing the world , it steadfastly remains in use . the author examines this idea further in relating the story of `` mary '' , the colour-deprived scientist . in `` consciousness explained '' , dennett proposed the multiple drafts model of consciousness and cognition . in this collection , he enhances the original concept . with no centre in the brain , consciousness necessarily must be a distributed process . the progress of imaging and other technologies have expanded our view of the brain 's functions . dennett argues that the brain is `` fame '' not `` television '' . the process is one of competition for dominance , no matter how fleeting . the mind is not a `` top-down '' or `` bottom-up '' process , but a `` sideways '' one . ideas , experiences and other informational bits jostle for `` clout '' . it 's not easy to shed the idea of a special `` self '' in your mind , but all that 's going on in there is still you . as usual , dennett has challenged successfully the `` established '' views of consciousness . clearly , he argues , consciousness is neither an arcane `` mystery '' nor beyond serious and definitive investigation . the mind-set erecting barricades using the bricks of `` qualia '' and the mortar of the `` cartesian theatre '' can , and must be , overcome for serious investigation to proceed . delicacy and care must be employed , but the prize is understanding .

children in new york 's ghettos . the fierce images of rat-infested homes , and schools filled with poisonous lead walls leave readers unable to fathom how people truly exist in such harsh conditions . kozol addresses every area of the spectrum from the children 's point of view to the political views of the country . also presenting an array of diverse issues such as aids , drugs , underage prostitution , death , motives based in moral , religious beliefs , and inhuman treatment towards others to the reader . feelings of pathos arise after hearing the accounts of the children in the area ; readers feel sorrow for the children because they are stripped of their childhood . numerous quotes and examples are given in the book , but one that particularly struck me was when kozol asks one of the children if he knows anyone happy at all the boy candidly responds , `` not many ... well , to tell the truth , not any who are happy for more than one day ... no ! not for one day . for 15 minutes ... not any . that 's no lie '' ( 212 ) . to honestly not know at least some form of happiness is incompressible for me and i 'm sure for many others as well . by using statements made by children the author easily wins the readers pity and sympathy . our pity soon turns to anger when he describes the lack of government support . examples such as unsanitary hospitals , toxic incinerators , closet sized school rooms , and shabby , less then adequate housing evoke sentiments of detest towards the government 's lack of aid towards these poor devastated people . but once again kozol quickly changes our feelings to those of denial . he provides shocking statistics and first hand accounts as to how the nation sympathizes with these people for five minutes and then continue on with their lives . it seems shocking that people would do things so cruel such as disposing of their waste in the ghetto streets . while reading , it became a necessity for me to remind myself that the events taking place were all true ; this is not a cleverly composed work of fiction , though it would certainly be far more assuaging if it were . taking into account the brilliant components of the book , i must say that i was vexed by one minor detail ; kozol 's overall presentation of his opinions . the beginning of the book revolves around the accounts of parents and children within the area and the author provides few opinions on the subject . but towards the end he fills several pages with statistics followed by passages of his opinions . i feel that this takes away from the book because rather than focusing on the children and people living in the area we turn our attention to the author and how he is impacted by the events and things he witnesses . other than this minor dislike i think that the piece as a whole is very informative and certainly does a good job at presenting what appears to be the ideas and realities for several minorities in new york . it may not be a thriller , or adventure novel , but it most certainly is a mystery . a mystery as to how people are able to survive in such hostile conditions and retain hope . kozol 's mastery of rhetoric reveals that the issues taking place have been around and that until something changes they will remain so ."}, {"num": 876, "context": "the bfg is scriddliumptiously good ! the bfg is a children 's book written by roald dahl , who wrote such classics as charlie and the chocolate factory , matilda , and james and the giant peach , and illustrated by quentin blake . the book was published in 1982 and immediately became popular amongst children and adults . the book won the federation of children 's book groups award in 1982 ( uk ) , and was named one of the `` best books of the past 20 years '' by the uk 's good book guide in 1997 . the story is about an orphan girl named sophie who , one night when she ca n't sleep , looks out her window to see a creepy looking giant blowing something into the windows where other children sleep . when the giant looks her right in the eye , sophie jumps to her bed , and hides under her blanket only to be snatched by the giant and taken away to his home . it turns out that the scary giant is none other than the bfg , or the big friendly giant , the only giant amongst the frightening human-eating giants who is a good giant , who satisfies his hunger on weird vegetables known as the snozzcumbers and drinks a delicious fizzy drink known as the frobscottle , which has bubbles that travel downwards that makes the drinker break wind instead of burp . the other giants are named the fleshlumpeater , the bonecruncher , the manhugger , the childchewer , the meatdripper , the gizzardgulper , the maidmasher , the bloodbottler , and the butcher boy . when sophie asks the bfg about what he does at night , he reveals his secret of blowing bottled dreams , nice dreams , into the windows of children 's bedrooms , something the other giants have no knowledge of . when he catches a nightmare , he destroys it so that nobody will ever have to experience it . sophie and the bfg become friends , and team up to rid the giant country and the world from the evil giants . so , the bfg mixes a dream showing what the giants do , which in turn becomes the worst nightmare the bfg had ever encountered , and takes it to buckingham palace and blows it into the queen 's bedroom , and leaves sophie on the windowsill , for the dream includes the knowledge that she would be there when the queen wakes up . when the queen awakens after the frightful dream , she believes sophie 's story , speaks to the bfg , and works along with sophie and the bfg to eliminate the child-eating giants . the bfg is a character that the reader will automaticaly like . his unusual features , and nonsensical vocabulary , are both funny and very appealing to children as well as adults . sophie is the young orphan girl who does an outstanding thing ( saving the world from the evil giants ) , a theme that had been used by dahl in other books like matilda . the book was very easy to read , and extremely amusing . dahl 's style and imaginative bfg dialogue tends to make children laugh and attempt to imitate . the story may also give the children a sense of fear or suspense ( the description of the evil giants and what they do ) . of course , the best thing about the bfg is the theme of good versus evil . it also shows that not just because someone might look unusual or scary means that that someone or thing is evil . in other words , you ca n't judge others by what they look like or how they look , but you can judge them only by their actions ; a very useful lesson of life for children . important note : some elements in the book may be offensive to some ethnic readers ( greeks , turks amongst others ) . recommended"}, {"num": 894, "context": "exchanges are the foundation of weight and blood sugar managment . there is nothing more basic for weight and blood sugar management than the food exchanges . they are called exchanges because the foods in each group can be exchanged with each other and still supply a similar amount of calories , proteins , carbohydrates , fats and other nutrients . `` the official pocket guide to dieabetic exchanges '' is an excellent resource for describing the nature and benefits of the exchanges . i have been a diabetic since the age of 50 . it is certainly easier to use the exchange system then laboriously counting calories and carbohydrates . they give us a short hand method of coming up with close approximations . one thing that can also be of benefit to diabetics is the glycemic index which measures the impact of various carbohydrates on our blood sugar level . glucose is given a value of 100 . all other foods are ranked according to the percentage rise they cause as compared to glucose . for example , apple juice has a glycemic index of 40 . this means that a serving of apple juice containing 25 grams of carbohydrates would cause a blood sugar rise that is 40 percent of that which would be caused by 25 grams of pure glucose . related to the glycemic index is the glycemic load which applied the glycemic index to serving sizes . to calculate the glycemic load the grams of carbohydrates ( less the fiber ) is multiplied by the glycemic index expressed as a percentage . an exchange of apple juice has 15 grams of carbohydrates . multiplying this by 40 % ( glycemic index of 40 ) yields a glycemic load of 6 . now lets compare this to 15 gm of watermelon . watermelon has a glycemic index of 72 which is higher than table sugar . the glycemic load of watermelon is 11 ( 15 x .72 = 11 ) . thus the impact of watermelon on our blood sugar is almost twice for the same level of carbohydrates . fortunately , a half of watermelon only has six grams of carbohydrates as compared to a half cup of apple juice which has 14 . measured on a volume basis the apple juice actually has a higher glycemic impact . no such luck with a baked potato which has a glycemic index of 85 . a half cup of baked potatoes has 38 grams of carbohydrate . this yields a glycemic load of 32 ( 38 x .95 = 32 ) . determining the glycemic impact of foods does require more effort than just counting exchanges . but by getting involved in the details i have been able to lose nearly 80 pounds and am able to manage my blood sugar levels with diet and exercise . this has certainly been a worthwhile effort for me . i am sure that it would be for others .

family in florence italy in the 15th century . a convergence of thinkers and doers all converged on florence , which became ground zero for the renaissance period . new concepts thrived in that environment where people were learning and listening to each other , breaking out of their own fields to combine ideas into revolutionary new areas of study . johansson asserts ( and correctly so , in my opinion ) that innovation thrives in these `` intersections '' that are missed by many , but offer the best chance for breaking away from the `` same old thing '' . the book is extremely practical , in that all the chapters are driven by real-life examples of these intersectional thinkers . you 'll see how richard garfield combined the idea of collectables and gaming to come up with the mega-hit card game magic : the gathering . the singer shakira takes musical styles from widely different cultures and combines them into a sound that is all her own ( and very popular to boot ) . eric bonabeau studied the activities of ants searching for food and applied the observations to network routing and scheduling . these and many other examples show how being a generalist ( or at least open

know a lot about these events even if you were n't alive in the 1950s . that 's because tinseltown has a vested interest in keeping the memory of this era alive . it was the era of the red scare , of senator joseph mccarthy waving his infamous list of communist subversives during a speech in west virginia . it was the time of congressional investigations , a time when invoking the fifth amendment might keep you safe from a contempt charge but would make you look guilty as sin in the public eye . for a select few the mccarthy era was a time of great fear , and no one feared this witch-hunt against communism more than hollywood . why ? because , despite the mountains of claims to the contrary that have emerged over the years , the movie industry oozed communists . there were so many reds in hollywood that they should have renamed the town little moscow . yet even today , you wo n't hear about this truth in the media . you will , however , get the skinny on what really went on if you pick up a copy of ronald radosh 's `` red star over hollywood : the film colony 's long romance with the left . '' talk about exploding myths ! radosh 's book , which he co-wrote with his wife allis , cuts through the layers of denial and presents us with an ugly picture of the real hollywood of the 1930s , 1940s , and 1950s . vladimir lenin , the little pipsqueak who brought the nightmare of marxism to the soviet union back in the early part of the twentieth century , had a soft spot for film and theater . he believed that the best way to spread communism around the globe was through movies and plays . this is exactly what the kremlin crowd set out to accomplish in the following decades . they managed to gain converts to their cause -- men who later became movers and shakers like budd schulberg , joseph losey , and maurice rapf -- by allowing them to work closely with the soviet film industry . once these people came back to the united states , they spread their plague to others with the help of party apparatchiks willi munzenberg , v.j . jerome , and john howard lawson . in no time at all , writes radosh , a branch of the communist party flourished in hollywood . so many big names signed on that newcomers to the industry , in an attempt to make contacts and find work , had to become communists or fellow travelers themselves . the hollywood branch of the communist party worked to increase their membership and influence in several ways . one of the most successful methods involved the tried and true `` united frontism '' and `` popular front '' techniques , or the forming of organizations that on the surface embraced popular progressive causes to lure in unsuspecting liberals while maintaining strong communist control behind the scenes . radosh reveals that the concerns many people had about the rise of national socialist germany in the 1930s helped increase membership , although the party 's propensity to change direction , oftentimes overnight according to directives issued from the kremlin , tended to alienate many members . also off putting was the heavy-handed discipline that could fall on an unsuspecting member at any time . albert maltz , for example , discovered the inflexibility of the party when he wrote an article deemed `` revisionist '' by the upper hierarchy . his very public refutation of his article left little doubt about the strong-arm tactics used behind the scenes . despite the ugliness the hollywood reds occasionally displayed , they were somewhat successful in spreading their propaganda through films like `` mission to moscow , '' `` the spanish earth , '' and `` the north star . '' congressional investigations threw some of these dupes in the slammer , and silenced a few more , but many never repudiated their warped views . i enjoyed radosh 's book , the first one of his i 've had the chance to read . the author and his spouse obviously know what they 're talking about and , since ronald radosh himself was a communist for many years , he understands how these groups think and act . `` red star over hollywood '' occasionally suffers from dry prose and a bewildering number of groups and individuals , but the authors always manage to bring the book back up to speed by throwing in some great anecdotes . for instance , the part where we learn about ronald reagan ( at the time a liberal ) and his buddy william holden crashing a communist get together in an attempt to inject some common sense into the proceedings is great fun to read about . reagan got up and started talking only to find himself under verbal attack for some forty minutes . god bless him ! the account of albert maltz 's forced rehabilitation is absolutely chilling , a sobering tale that hints at the violent tendencies inherent in communism . arguably the best part of the book , however , involves the long , strange trip writer dalton trumbo took from the time of his blacklisting to his repudiation of the communist party later in life . so many intriguing stories pop up in the book that the actual creation of the blacklist takes a backseat . i have one recommendation and one warning to those readers about to attempt the book . in the case of the former , if you 're not very familiar with this time period , read a background history of the red scare first . doing so will assist you in learning the context for what happens here and help you learn the basics about a few of the groups and personalities associated with the blacklist . in the case of the latter , the topic is so huge that radosh does n't have the space to cover many of the important reds . there is almost nothing here about lillian hellman or dashiell hammett , for example , and both of those individuals had a lot to do with the influence of communism in film and books . nevertheless , this book is well worth your time . read it and remember it the next time hollywood releases yet another `` we were innocent '' propaganda piece ."}, {"num": 945, "context": "excellent instruction for insight meditation insight ( mindfulness ) meditation - the vipassana meditation of theravada buddhism - can change your life whether you are buddhist or not , and this is one of three books that can take you there . to get acquainted with this excellent meditation method and for lots of inspiration to try it , start with `` wherever you go , there you are '' by jon kabat-zinn . then , to learn more about just how to do it , move on to `` mindfulness in plain english '' by henepola gunaratana . now you 're ready for the big leagues of mindfulness - larry rosenberg 's outstanding book , `` breath by breath : the liberating practice of insight meditation '' . he takes the potentially complex topic of how to do this meditation just as the buddha taught it , and explains the entire anapanasati ( mindfulness with breathing ) method in a way that westerners can understand and relate to . i 've practiced insight meditation for more than a decade , and have accumulated a pretty good library of books on buddhism and on meditation . larry rosenberg 's book - which i 've read and re-appreciated several times - is one of the last ones i 'd be willing to part with"}, {"num": 950, "context": "excellent book -- -highly recommended though i have since made a career change , i realized , as i read this book for the umpteenth time a few weeks ago , it was one of the driving forces in my decision to become a counselor . many times i have seen in families , the battered women and children i 've worked with and counseled , the need to love and be loved , to not be lonely . we are told that we will become more lovable as we choose the right clothes , perfume , shampoo , even toothpaste ! the list of products , guaranteeing that we will have would-be lovers banging at our door , that we will never be lonely as long as we buy these products is endless . our media-oriented society measures lovability by : popularity , sex-appeal , the right clothes and products . living by these standards alone makes us lonely , especially if we ca n't live up to them . these standards are only masks , hiding us from not only our inner selves , but those of others as well . marie , the main character in the book `` daughter of earth '' struggles with her loneliness . she wants what we all want - to be loved and not have to prove that we are adequate enough to be loved . `` marie lives out her whole life struggling to act as a whole person - to give and receive love in a relationship of equality - and to work against oppression - despite the image that inhabits her imagination . '' from a very young age , marie learned of the world 's contradictions . she learned how devalued women were , `` that even male animals cost more than female animals and seemed more valuable ; that male fowls cost more than females and were chosen with more care . '' with the birth of her little brother , marie realized how important a son was for there was much celebration as cigars and whiskey were passed around . she also saw how the lives of those in poverty were worthless and that `` the companies '' these people worked for only cared about the profit they were making rather than the lives and safety of their employees . `` coal was dear ... life was cheap . '' as marie watched married women around her , she realized that the `` love expressed in sex enslaves and humiliates '' them . `` it is the toll men exact for giving economic protection to their wives . the weeping of wives - what is more bitter ?

'' it was through a man named sardarji , that marie learned what it meant to love and be loved . and through her experiences with him she learned that love means to get over who we are because of our culture , our values , or the decisions we make . through sardarji , marie `` touched for the first time a movement of unwavering principle and beauty ... and saw that difference of race , color and creed are as shadows on the face of a stream , each lending a beauty of its own ; that subjection of any kind and in any place is beneath the dignity of man ... '' sardarji taught marie that we ca n't live without loving all humankind ; that we must do as sardarji told marie : `` make conviction the basis of our actions . we must fight for what we believe in rather than fighting for something we know nothing about or for something we are told to fight for . we must think about what it means to fight . we must know what we are fighting for before we able to help and before we can enlist the help of others .

study blues legacies , it would be better if a blues singer like memphis minnie , one of the greatest female instrumental blues singers , were included . surely , dinah washington , justifiably named the queen of the blues , or ruth brown , ( miss or maybe now ms rhythm ) would be more appropriate to a study of black blues women . this hints that the generalizations in this book may be the result of pushing around reality rather than studying it . this is an all too frequent problem in the writing of academics who seem more concerned about creating their own little niche of analysis , than situating their work in the realities of life , culture , and art where the blues or jazz , and billie 's real life live . billie did not like to be called a blues singer . if we are concerned with the voices of black women , then someone involved in this book should have at least had the respect to listen to billie holiday 's voice on the matter . she considered herself a jazz singer and later a cabaret singer . she recorded very few blues . the two blues she recorded again and again `` billie 's blues '' and `` fine and mellow '' were only recorded because in two different recording sessions there was time to record additional songs , but no preparation or charts existed for any song , so an easy to play blues was selected . billie recorded them and performed these two tunes often because she had the author 's credit and publishing on them which made it easier and more profitable . this is despite the fact that the exact word sets had been sung and recorded by real blues singers before billie had the brains to record and copyright them . listen to helen humes sing an exact version of fine and mellow with another name during the first spirituals to swing concert that took place before billie recorded her version . a good contrast with billie , though male , was her friend and often colleague jimmie rushing who served with her in the basie band . despite his penchant for claiming he was a ballad singer as well -- rushing actually thought that when billie left basie that rather than hiring another singer , he alone could fill the gap -- rushing 's recordings with walter page 's blue devils in the 1920s , with moten in the early 1930s , and with basie in the 1930s and 1940s are masterpieces of the blues . many of his renditions like good morning blues have become standards for blusicians of all stripes . lesser known but deserving more attention are his great blues recorded with kc musicians for john hammond on vanguard in the 1960s . otherwise she recorded few blues , particularly in her most artistically developed period between 1934 and 1945 . indeed , billie 's lack of a blues repertoire and disinclination to perform blues cost her her position as female vocalist with the count basie orchestra , a match made in heaven . while there were no doubt other factors involved , many basieites especially buck clayton who was quite close to billy have said billie was replaced because she did n't perform enough blues to suit john hammond who acted as de facto manager and ar man with the basie band . hammond replaced billie holiday with helen humes who had been recording blues for ten years before she joined basie . humes , of course , continued to record blues with basie , and then as an independent singer from then until her death keeping her magnificent jump blues alive for several generations of listeners . clayton 's complaint is a standard one leveled at white jazz producers like hammond and norman grantz that they wanted blues , not more harmonically developed music that black jazz musicians really wanted to play . the blues is a specific genre of african american musical , poetic , and cultural expression with its own distinct history , evolution , and practices . simply collapsing every black performer into the blues makes the blues meaningless and demeans the work of the millions of women and men who have created the blues in the last 110-120 years . another insult to billie , is the tendency to see her as a `` blues figure '' because of her `` tragic '' life . this is the tendency to evaluate billie as the public life disaster that she tended to milk in desperation in the last years of her life symbolized by the fake autobiography _lady sings the blues_ . this contrasts than the artistic consideration she deserved and received from other musicians and singers . she was a competent and practicing jazz artist , raised in the music business ( her father complained he played guitar for every jazz artist in nyc in the 1930s and early 1940s but billie . her mother boarded musicians and catered musical parties ) . from a young age , billie was considered as knowledgeable as the top instrumentalists of the music by those top instrumentalists . those who rely on the `` tragedy '' to induct billie into the blues express a greater ignorance given that as her own drug addiction advanced , her music had less and less of a connection with the blues , climaxing in `` the lady in satin '' which is a vain attempt to take the lady into non-jazz pop . all of her original blues were recorded in her pre-heroin youth in the 1930s , not in the 1950s when billie 's self-made `` tragedy '' had begun to destroy her voice and musicial viability and then her life . it is quite bizarre for anyone to claim billie 's performance of meeropol 's song `` strange fruit , '' has any relationship to blues music given her very straight reading of the tune , the unblueslike straight minor it is given , and the unjazzlike accompaniment . if one wants to see what a blues singer can do to this song , one needs to listen to the astounding version recorded by josh white which is blusey and also more dramatic and satisfying than holiday 's more celebrated version . holiday 's performance of `` strange fruit , '' tends to be elevated by folks for the justifiable political message the song provided and the controversy involved . however , an honest or even rational evaluation of the performance seems to be unavailable these days . this raises yet another ignorance , the

his sentence construction is strong and his mastery of the craft evident . i 'm going to try another of his novels just because i believe this was an aberration caused by an author with an axe to grind and no right way to do it . another problem was that he telegraphed the plot . the only one stupid enough not to see who was behind the murder and conspiracy was justin himself . while this can work , showing the reader what the protagonist ca n't see ( see fight club ) , in this case it 's just painful to have to slough through the machinations of bumbling intrigue with a dull and plodding man . in summary , i did n't care about characters and i lost interest in the plot and the theme seemed contrived . i ca n't recommend it . -

( sigh ) . in sandition : arthur parker is an `` invalid '' who realizes that perhaps , not only is he not an invalid but that there are people fairing far worse then him and do not complain . he falls for a young woman who truly is fragile but makes no complaints , only attempts to live each good day she has to the fullest . he learns from her what it is to be healthy . they both grow and support each other in a common goal that gets them out of a smoke filled tea room and into the fresh sea breezes . he collects and she draws what he collects . he learns to protect her ( instead of whining over his bouts and supposed illnesses ) and she learns to be stronger . sandition is also a book in which you can actually see charlotte and sidney fall in love . you can watch her struggle over `` does he or does he not '' . it 's a much more delightful alternative to all the `` our herione '' and `` our hero '' and `` my herione '' and `` my hero '' 's that go on in charlotte ( if i read one more of those i thought i would choke ) . so , to sum up ?

i know previous editions promoted her own line of cosmetics , i did n't bother to find out if she 's still doing so . erno laszlo had as his clients years ago movie stars such as marilyn monroe , gloria swanson , greta garbo and joan crawford - you can read in `` mommy dearest '' how crawford 's daughter thought her mother was obsessive in the way she rinsed her face repeatedly each morning and evening ! the reason erno laszlo had these clients is because his system works . it 's not cheap , it 's very expensive , but it works . most definitely , it works . last week , i was `` carded '' ! quite a compliment for a someone who 's been a mom for over 32 years"}, {"num": 1165, "context": "replica of her amanda quick 's scandal if you 've read her amanda quick novels , this contemporary story is almost the exact replica of the novel , `` scandal '' . heroine proposes to hero , who has a hidden agenda . of course he 's rich and he has almost the same history as `` scandal '' , whose father has gotten into debt and gets out of the picture leaving the family to deal w/ the debt , and the oldest child having to pay back debts that his father 's friends/business associates want paid right away . of course hero grows up and wants vengence for this when he grows up . but his plans get waylaid when heroine interferes and convinces hero that vengence is not the right path . the book is so similar that a couple of times i caught myself looking at the cover to make sure i had the right book . the only difference in this book is that one is set in contemporary times and the other in historical time"}, {"num": 1166, "context": "pure shlock i generally do n't enjoy reading books with teenaged legs and sunflowers on the cover . i often read on the subway , and it can be a bit embarassing . if i chose to weather the pornographic implications of such cover art , i expect to be rewarded for my sacrifice -- with , say -- a good book . i 'd even settle for full characters who change and grow . i 'd settle for dialogue that occasionally rose above tediousness and pointlessness -- perhaps dialogue that , in fact , advanced the plot or advanced character development . if i am going to sit on the l train with a book that slightly resembles a baby-sitters club epic , i would like for that book to be enriching/rewarding/entertaining/redeeming . why is this book 400 pages long ?

often . having biases is bad ( he scapegoats religious and political ideologies ) . social scientists are n't brave enough ( the author seems to idolize galileo and darwin ) . social scientists whine too much ( about how *hard* their science is - my whining is in the next paragraph ) . social scientists need to look at the data instead of relying on armchair theorizing . people do n't really want to understand human behavior . yep , i think that 's about it . now , repeat this in as many ways as possible and you can stretch it into a very short book . the author turns a good word and thus the book is an easy read ( thus the two stars ) . as much as i might agree with some of his points , he overstates them ( he caricatures social scientists as ignorant ideologues uninterested in data ) and misses many important ones regarding the challenges of the field . if i had as much control over humans as physicists and chemists have over their subject matter , things would be a lot easier . so-called `` hard '' scientists do n't have to ask the subjects of their inquiry if they want to participate in their experiments . they also have much greater control of extraneous variables ( can i *please* be allowed to raise humans in the lab ? ? ? can i *please* be allowed to run experiments on societies , governments , races , companies , ... by changing their laws , rules , structures , income , etc . to my hearts content ? ) . the book would have been much less repetitious if he would have seriously considered the other challenges facing the social sciences instead of assuming that they 're all easily surmountable . hint : think weather prediction and you 'll better understand the challenges of the social sciences . the author needs to check his own biases at the door - it 's obvious that he 's a liberal atheist ( as he was free to admit ) . in sum - read the second paragraph of my review and you 've gotten the gist of the author 's message . skip the book ."}, {"num":

after all , we know that the israelis , good or bad , do want peace and do need peace . they spent the past several decades building up a nation . and they want to keep it . that is one reason they need peace . and that is also a reason why it is easy to tempt them with bogus offers of peace , just like tempting a fish with bait on a hook . but just as fish need food , israelis need peace . huband did n't say that . but we know that israelis really do want peace . we know that if israelis are innocent victims , they want peace . we know that if israelis are guilty thieves , they still want peace , just to keep their illicit gains . what does it mean for huband to imply that israelis do not really want ( or do not really appear to want ) peace ? well such a claim is surely a falsehood . but more than that , it is a taunt . after all , suppose a bully decides to beat you up . and suppose that bully claims you want to fight ! obviously , you may well prefer to be left alone to being beaten up . what the bully is saying is a taunt . it 's more than a mere falsehood . it is a blatant way for bullies to tease their victims . that means that huband 's book is taunting israelis . that 's not a very good thing for a journalist to do . it goes beyond telling mere falsehoods . huband also implies that jews have taken arab land , and admit to it . and that they have taken an arab country ! i wonder which one ? and i also wonder if buying land at high prices constitutes `` taking '' it . after all , we humans are living on the same planet as the one that existed in 1805 . not one human who was alive in 1805 is alive today . have we all stolen the planet from them ? of course not . we have bought it and inherited it . there has been some theft , but that is no reason to invalidate the right of all humans to live on this planet today . huband implies that the arabs ought to have a greater right to steal jewish land than the jews do to own the land they bought at high prices . that 's bad journalism too . and there 's more . the author calls former israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu an `` extremist . '' now , i might understand making some snide remark about former prime minister yitzhak shamir , who after all was a former leader of the stern gang . one might even do the same for former prime minister menachim begin , who was a former leader of the irgun . but netanyahu ? once again , this is poor journalism . and by the way , you might want to see how often the author calls any arabs `` extremists . '' it is true that antisemitic propaganda and incitement in the arab world has reminded many israelis of similar propaganda and incitement in germany in the 1930s . and that has resulted in some analogies being made between arab antisemitism today and german antisemitism before and during world war two . huband makes fun of such analogies . i think he should have taken them seriously . more bad journalism . the author does take benjamin beit-hallahmi seriously , though . huband quotes him to explain that the arabs are `` innocent bystanders , '' and that the jews are visiting revenge on the arabs for european antisemitism ! this is total nonsense , of course . more bad journalism . now , does a `` one-state '' solution to the arab-israeli conflict make sense ? maybe so . israel exists in order to protect jewish rights and to provide a refuge for jews . it exists to provide a state where jews will speak hebrew natively , attend hebrew schools universities , have hebrew traditions , and so forth . it can do all that in a state which has a large non-jewish population . and israel , even with ten thousand square miles , would be rather small for a state which houses over five million jews . if jewish rights to life , liberty , property , and immigration are protected , a one-state solution may be best . besides , while many people say that another arab state is needed as well , i see no real need for one except as a mechanism to attack or destroy israel . the author agrees that a one-state solution is best . and i think he even acknowledges that israel is part of the middle east . but it seems to me that his reason for wanting a one-state solution is to demolish jewish rights rather than support them . and getting rid of human rights would be bad for everyone in the region . this book is a good one to avoid"}, {"num": 1316, "context": "a difficult read if you just want the meat maybe this book contains some good advice . but i gave it a low rating because you have to wade through so much fluff to find it . i seriously doubt i 'll make it all the way through the book . the first part of the book talks about michael gerber 's ( fictitious ? ) mentee sarah , a previous client of his who has apparently fallen and ca n't get up . the conversations between michael and sarah are so contrived and syrupy , who can believe them ? sarah needs to climb a mountain in nepal , discover the meaning of life , and get it over with . the second part , which i 'm reading now , is structured around the 7 `` disciplines '' for building a company . i skipped ahead to this part , but it refers back to so much of the fluff in the first part that i really feel lost not having read it . if you like business story books of the patrick lencioni variety , you might get something out of e myth mastery . but be warned : this book as many times longer than lencioni 's , with a lot less meat"}, {"num": 1317, "context": "disappointing the book starts on the premise that competitive strategy is a complex subject and that michael porter did give us a good structure/framework to analyze this phenomenon to succeed in the market place . then the author is quick to add that among all forces analyzed by porter , `` barriers to entry '' is the most significant factor that affects competitive strategy . this is how the author sets the stage to explain `` competition demystified '' with this quick and firm conclusion on the most significant factor affecting competitive strategy , the book starts off with case after case to justify this hypothesis . to simplify things , it looks at sustained profit margins and continuity of the key players in the given space as a proof for entry barriers . this approach is perhaps to support the second part of the title of the book `` a radically simplified approach to business strategy `` . granted that the cases discussed do justify the assumptions and are supported by hard facts or published numbers . but if competition lends itself to just a couple of variables , then every company can follow the strategy and hence no competition at all ! . in fact one can say `` the end of competition '' . kindly recall `` the end of history ...

we must note that at least in the usa , there are two quite different branches of conservativism , one espousing religious fundamentalism and the other classical economic liberalism . they have almost nothing in common intellectually and are simply politically linked by historical events . arnhart does not stress this point . arnhart 's arguments directed towards religious conservatism can be summarized as : ( a ) evolutionary biology is compatible with belief in god ; ( b ) evolutionary biology recognizes and reinforces the notion that religious belief is a universal element of human nature ; and ( c ) a strong adherence to family values is part of human nature . i agree with these statements , but arnhart never addresses the burning issues , which include abortion , homosexuality , gay marriage , and state-religion separation . he does deal with intelligent design , which he rejects as a scientific theory . this is in part why i call his book `` disingenuous : '' he simply avoids the hard topics . turning to classical liberalism , arnhart says that darwinian evolution supports a burkean political philosophy . i think this is a plausible argument , although arnhart avoids all the hard questions by choosing as the alternative political philosophy an absurd caricature of the leftist alternative that is more or less 19th century utopianism . societies grow organically , arnhart says , and can not be socially engineered using the principles of reason alone . of course this is correct , but this is accepted by all relevant political philosophers today ( except peter singer and his bizarre ilk ) . what about the proper extent of government , the treatment of poverty , the environment , and foreign relations ?

'' who would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with the irreproachable rhetoric of `` progressivism ? '' i would . dewey 's conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming from nature study . this he then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating transitions and answering the child 's self-posed questions . the problems in dewey 's model begin with his science fair-meets-museum-meets-playground-meets-lecture hall school design : the model is untested on any large scale and the cost plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive . classes are small and require several specialists and non-reusable materials . as if kids did n't have enough problems with the basic skills set already , dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home economics . even more outrageous in dewey 's model is the premise that we ought never force students to study what they do not like . their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by implication , teachers are discouraged from evaluating against solid standards . experienced teachers know that kids can easily hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak subjects , and that remediation is hard to implement before they slip further behind . how could dewey 's recommendation to cater almost exclusively to the child 's intrinsic likes not further disguise and exacerbate low performance ? deweyism of course , like many other off-the-wall theories of education , denies behaviorism when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man . it depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality . nothing could less representative of the quality research conducted , particularly project follow through : the great skeleton in the student-centered advocates ' closet . i 'd personally like to see dewey 's updated plan for seamlessly moving kids , who come into class with their `` natural inquisitiveness '' programmed by tv , rap music , and other pop media , into colonial american history , calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes , tennessee williams , and the `` plus-que-parfait '' tense . but of course , such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly throw out the old-fashioned academic corpus along with the old-fashioned school system . 90 % of students in high schools today report that they do not feel adequately challenged . maybe the answer does n't lie in yielding to children 's lack of intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control that uninformed caprice . dewey 's `` progressivism '' relies upon the contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on its own education . from the absurdity of it , i can only conclude that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop-out rates , lowered

' it is a defense of his own personal christian beliefs and there is virtually no mention of other religions nor recognition of differences within christianity itself . mcgrath makes an argument that we can only be agnostic yet only applies this to atheists and clearly not to himself and other christians . he does not say what he believes about the many other gods and spirits etc humans believe or believed in though it is only possible to conclude that he must be an atheist where they are concerned . there is a valid point he makes about the correlation between religious belief and health and well-being but this does not mean that religious belief is the cause of the health . if religious belief caused good health and well-being then , as the vast majority of people who have ever lived have had one religious belief or another , we would expect the world have always been overflowing with health etc . this is obvously not the case . the only evidence offered for god is how nature makes us feel - nature being the pointer towards the beauty of god . he conveniently avoids telling us what parasites , diseases , predation , tsunamis etc etc tell us about god . mcgrath says that the question of god 's existence is not a scientific question . 'it 's more like the question of whether democracy is better than totalitarianism . ' precisely ! religions are the products of ( almost exclusively ) male minds . they are linked to self-interested tribal identity both to bond and identify 'us ' and distinguish us from 'them ' . and this is where dawkins is lost on mcgrath - dawkins ' writings undermine the very foundations for divisions and hierarchies not only of humans but of all life . dawkins ' frustration no doubt partly comes from the fact that evolved human tribalism is as ingrained as it so unfortunately is . mcgrath himself knows and says that religious belief is about identity and status . finally , mcgrath never touches on the most obvious point of religion - the promise of immortality . if this is not self-interested narcissism , a need to believe oneself so special that one can not die and will reap great rewards in heaven , then i do n't know what is . the dangers involved in this thinking are not addressed . if mcgrath truly believes we can all only be agnostic then he should be trying to persuade his fellow believers and not just atheists . if religious people worldwide adopted agnosticism it may dampen the flames of divisive , tribal religious fervor and increase general humility to everyone 's benefit . in the meantime i 'm looking forward to reading dawkins ' 'the god delusion '"}, {"num": 1486, "context": "sham not shaman after reading the book medicine woman and the san francisco review of books on the back which says this is an autobiographical i have to question a few things . i come from manitoba and have lived there over 50 years . i 've never heard of a crowley and the cree first nations in manitoba that i was raised with would not be seeing a kokopelli or a kachina . it 's not part of their culture . the last and final huge mistake is the fact that most of this story could not have taken place outside without huge huge bottles of mosquitoe repellant as anyone who lives in the bush in manitoba knows especially those who may have a reason to go naked in the woods . perhaps lynn should n't be peddling her strange brand of spiritualism as true when it 's not . there are enough charlatans in the world without one stealing someone 's culture and calling it her own for the sake of the almight dollar . carol"}, {"num": 1495, "context": "the `` waiting for godot '' of novels the moviegoer is a book about a 30 year , disaffected businessman . he 's successful and liked , from a rich new orleans family , but bored with life . he does n't know what he wants , and does n't know what to do about it . this description , however , sounds like binx bolling , the main character , is actually doing something to figure out what 's wrong . unfortunately , the book just follows him around through his life over the course of a week and describes his boredom and dissatisfaction with the things around him . while interesting from a theoretical , philosophical , existential point of view , it makes for boring reading . in addition , the book , released in 1960 feels badly dated , about a time and place that no longer exists , so while i have experienced my own bouts of existential angst , binx 's problems are not mine and the book is not written in a way to help sympathize with his plight . this is in stark contrast to kafka , for example , whose stories of frustration and nothingness from 19th century prague can bring me to tears . while the novel is set in new orleans , there is little description to make the unique setting visible other than the names of a few streets . similarly , binx remains a faceless everyman , and the women he dates so interchangeable that binx himself can barely keep them distinct . the title , too , is misleading . `` the moviegoer '' made me expect a story about a person who lived his life through characters in the movies . while binx does attend movies regularly and describes people in terms of long forgotten actors , i have to assume the title refers to binx 's problem of watching life around him without participating the same way as we watch a movie . like the existential play `` waiting for godot '' this story is mostly about the lack of a story , and though things happen , there is little sense of suspense or caring to carry the narrative forward . if you 're looking for an existential novel , i 'd strongly recommend kafka 's the castle or the trial instead . and if you 're looking for an enjoyable novel that truly distills the distinctiveness of new orleans with a truly memorable set of characters , a confederacy of dunces ( john kennedy toole ) ( which walker percy was instrumental in having published after the suicide of the author ) is among the best novels of our times . but the moviegoer is a hard slog for little payoff ."}, {"num": 1514, "context": "let him walk the plank -

'' but the thing that bothered me the most was his inconsistency . he berates the industry for alleged mistreatment of their employees and yet he himself seems to cause those employees more trouble that 99 % of the other passengers and he ca n't figure out why those employees , like the bartender on page 157 , whom he nagged for several days , hate him so much . he berates the passengers and ships for causing pollution , yet he himself has taken ( and presumably will try to take ) multiple cruises . the massive improvements in waste management and sanitation and pollution control and fuel efficiency are dismissed as not enough . he nitpicks about occasional oil spills but fails to mention that according to the us coast guard 99 % of the oil pollution of the seas comes from natural sources , mainly undersea vents . but what 's this ?

the result , zia , is terribly disappointing . for starters , fans of karana wo n't have much to read about . at least half of the book deals with her niece and nephew trying to go to the island to rescue her . the story is told completely from the niece 's point of view . we never get to hear what karana herself thought about experiencing a new land and being reunited with people after so many years , and the sadness she must have faced at finding that her tribe was gone . we learn almost nothing about what happened to karana 's father and sister , just that her sister 's children have ended up orphans in a missionary . and sadly , there 's nothing interesting about karana 's niece zia and her brother . they merely serve as plot devices to stretch this paper-thin story out over 100 pages or so . i now appreciate the `` cliffhanger '' ending of island of the blue dolphins in its perfect simplicity . it is better to leave the story when karana leaves the island , and let it be . your own imagination about what it was like for karana to live at a missionary where no one spoke her language and there was no trace of her tribe left is better than the depressing depiction of her life in zia . i wish i could erase zia from my mind . zia truly is a sequel that should not have been written"}, {"num": 1535, "context": "author sneaks in biblical misinterpretation , poor editing . i got this as both a book and an audio file . i had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author , but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts ( e.g. , i gasped when he suggested christ went to hell ... what bible passage evidences this ?

the animal rights issue is a tricky one , because it touches on really deep questions about what it means to be conscious , to have rights , and to experience suffering . so you might expect a philosopher to be able to sort through the ethical issues and suggest a way forward . if so , you would be disappointed by this book . the first chapter lays out the philosophical foundation of the book . singer argues that there 's really no basis for assigning equal rights to all humans , since different humans have different abilities . therefore equality must be based on the recognition of another person 's interests . since animals have interests too , they deserve equal treatment . that 's it . it 's not terribly deep , and frankly not even rational , but singer does n't bother to elaborate . so if animals have interests , then they obviously have an interest in not suffering . how do we know animals are capable of suffering ? according to singer there are two signs : they seek to avoid painful stimuli and they have nervous systems that bear a superficial similarity to those of humans . he does n't say how he came up with these criteria , but they seem awfully generous to me . in fact , based on those criteria one would conclude that monkeys are capable of understanding spoken language and that humans are capable of echolocation . monkeys do in fact respond to certain vocalizations , and they have all the relevant physiological structures for understanding speech . and humans actually can echolocate ( with a lot of practice ) . the point is that you would never seriously compare human echolocation to bat echolocation , and the ability of monkeys to process speech is negligible relative to that of humans . could this also be true of the capacity for pain and suffering ? i do n't think anyone knows , and singer does n't shed any light on the subject . the next chapter is about animal testing , and a lot of the chapter deals with the use of animals in scientific experiments . this is the weakest part of the book . singer finds some of the most gruesome experiments in science history , and juxtaposes them with out-of-context quotes from the researchers to make it look like the research was useless . he mentions in passing that the vast majority of animal experiments do n't involve pain , but by the end of the chapter he suggests that all medical experimentation should eventually be stopped . part of his justification for ending medical experiments is the notion that such experiments do n't actually contribute to medical or scientific progress . this idea is unfortunately quite common among people who do n't know anything about medicine or science . however it 's completely incorrect , and most of singer 's arguments regarding the scientific value of animal testing have been completely debunked . for example , he continues to exploit the thalidomide tragedy , even though it was already known at the time the book was written that that incident was unrelated to animal testing . in addition to being totally confused about science , singer seems uncomfortable with the scientific method itself . he repeatedly suggests that animal testing should , in the short term , be limited to experiments that will lead to rapid advances in medical treatment . this is like saying you should look for your lost car keys where you left them . science does n't work this way . at one point ( p. 47 ) , singer complains about a series of experiments that were shown `` first to prove a theory , then to disprove the theory , and finally to support modified versions of the original theory . '' this probably sounds ridiculous to a philosopher , but it 's actually a pretty good description of the scientific method . the next chapter deals with factory farming , and here singer is on firmer ground . as in the previous chapter , there 's no philosophy , or even rational discourse . it 's just page after page of description , in this case of the conditions of animals on a large farm . however , in contrast to the chapter on experimentation , the conditions he describes are standard practice for the majority of farm animals . here it would seem that there 's plenty of room for improvement with comparatively minimal consequences for humans ( although i imagine the situation has only gotten worse since the publication of the second edition of the book in 1990 ) . the next chapter deals with vegetarianism , calling for a boycott of meat and dairy products . again the appeal is basically emotional , and if you were moved by the arguments of the preceding chapter , you will presumably find this chapter convincing . curiously singer does n't call for a similar boycott of medicine or medical treatment , even though the argument would be identical . even if you belief that animal experimentation is useless for human medicine , you have to admit that the purchase of such medicine directly pays for more animal research . anyone who 's receiving treatment for cardiac problems or diabetes , or who has ever had surgery , or who takes prescription drugs , is contributing to animal suffering . maybe singer deals with this in another book , but given the chapter on vegetarianism it 's a rather obvious omission . the next chapter is a strangely out of place history of human attitudes toward animals , going back several thousand years . it might have made sense to put this at the beginning of the book , but perhaps his editor was afraid of losing readers . the last chapter talks about some popular animal rights movements and their accomplishments . singer does n't draw any line between violent organizations like the animal liberation front ( which the fbi considers a terrorist organization ) and organizations that actually help animals in a peaceful way ( like the aspca ) . he speaks positively of peta , which in addition to other extremist activities , supports violence and arson . i do n't know why he would do this . ultimately this is a bad book . it trivializes a serious issue by substituting emotional imagery for rational argumentation . the fact is that humans can benefit greatly from actions that adversely affect animals . in the realm of science , there is no serious doubt that the length and quality of human life have been improved through animal testing . with other behaviors , such as meat-eating , the benefits are more subjective and the suffering is probably greater . how we assign weight to these costs and benefits is a very difficult question that singer does n't even attempt to take seriously"}, {"num": 1541, "context":

excited to read some good journalism about the hottest business topic of the day . i was sure that battelle , who had been chronically his progress on the book on his own blog , would deliver . halfway through the book ( in a matter of three days - a possible sign pointing to its lack of depth ) i 'm realizing that this is not the case . thus far , i have two major gripes with the book . the first is the writing itself . the book is written in informal magazine style , in keeping with his roots as a `` cutting edge '' technology writer ( having worked for wired and business 2.0 , magazines that try desperately to be `` too cool for the room '' ) . this would be fine enough , except that battelle has a habit of jumping around from year to year , talking about decisions made by players in google 's history before he actually introduces them . he never fully explains why it was important for sergey brin and larry page - google 's founders - to resign their chairman and ceo posts , nor does he tell the reader what their new titles are . battelle also has a habit of reintroducing people several times , a practice which at times seems a cheap way to up his page count . his writing style thoroughly muddles however much thoughtfulness there was to his project . i considered keeping a tally of how many times he used `` well '' as an interjection , but lost interested after i ran out of fingers . on page 150 he discusses a lack of managerial prowess on the part of brin , page and new ceo eric schmidt . according to battelle , one of google 's investors , john doerr , insisted that intuit founder bill campbell come on as a leadership coach . battelle uses an anecdote from journalist john heilemann 's gq article on google , which quotes doerr as saying , `` i do n't know where the company would be without him . '' however , battelle does n't include any of his own reporting on what campbell actually did . neglecting to explain right away what this `miraculous ' shift was is , in my own journalistic view , irresponsible . not to mention that he does n't include the actual title of heilemann 's article in either the main book or the citations . later in the book on page 172 , he tries to play the role of not only a technology writer , and search historian , but also media theorist and critic , waxing about how google ought to be considered a media company - not just a technology company . in the book 's final chapter , battelle introduces the idea of having several different kinds of information contribute to `` perfect search , '' including every tech writer and journalist 's favorite idea , the blog . he bulldozes through a description of the blog and later posits that we have reached the critical mass point , `` but we do n't know it yet . '' i suspect that battelle means that he 's savvier than users and other writers and he knows something we do n't , but he does n't explain why he thinks we 've reached the tipping point , nor what that means in the overall discussion of what the blog can do . though battelle tries to play his book as a `` history of search , '' it is nowhere near as comprehensive as such a book must be . it is a book that sings the praises of google , nothing more . however , that the book is a history of google is fine . the company certainly is interesting and large enough to warrant an historical account and battelle ought to be forthcoming with his intent . the short discussions he does include of the company 's search engine precursors such as lycos and alta-vista need considerable expansion and deserve to be considered as more than also-rans , if he really wants to be considered the historian of search and not just google 's unofficial corporate historian ."}, {"num": 1557, "context": "try not to drown ... if there were a dictionary of queer literature radclyffe hall would certainly have a place , somewhere between `` hall , maurice '' and `` hallward , basil '' . she deserves this for having written a taboo-breaking novel . she does not deserve this for writing a particularly good one . when i started reading this book i thought i was going to like it a lot more than i did in the end ;

'' instead , the solutions he predicts are purely materialistic : brain deciphering , massively parallel hardware , and genetic algorithms . part 2 of the book focuses on potential technologies . the most powerful computers he speculates about are quantum computers , and he does n't waste any time before asserting that someday we will be able to download the entirety of a brain into a quantum computer , so that the computer will in effect have a clone of that person 's mind . kurzweil , in his materialism , does not seem to even be aware that there is a philosophical argument that this is impossible . he also speculates about nanotechnologies and how they will eventually give us a unprecented ability to manipulate physical reality . part 3 of the book is comprised of specific predictions for 2009 , 2019 , 2029 , and 2099 . this book was written in 1999 , and we can already see that some of his 2009 predictions are either just simple extensions of things we were starting to see in 1999 , while others wildly miss the mark , such as : `` the majority of reading is done on displays '' , `` the majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition '' , and `` intelligent roads are in use , primarily for long-distance travel . '' that kurzweil could be so far off in his 10 year predictions does not bode well for his 20- , 30- , and 100-year predictions . indeed , his predictions for 2019 sound like a science fiction novel , and of the ones that sound plausible i think he must be off by at least 30 years . his speculations for 2029 are just fantastic . in general he seems to `` predict '' based on the assumption that new technologies will be deployed as soon as they are available , underestimating a myriad of resisting factors : legal , political , social , market , scientific , etc . ultimately this book can be fun for skimming and raises a couple of thought-provoking issues , but as speculating about technology more than 10 years in the future is necessarily a foolish activity , there 's plenty of foolishness

french & italians got their reputations as great lovers . is this the best that english literature can give us ? this fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy , let alone female sexuality . it 's also mean-spirited . lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman , and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept . this is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal . he drips way too much contempt . everything outside of sex is dumb , meaningless , ridiculous . attempting to derive enjoyment from the `` mental life '' makes one ridiculous ; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous ; trying to have sex in any way outside lawrence 's own true and correct way makes one pathetic , or defective , or spiteful ; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of `` woman '' or `` man '' ; and so on . looking at italian art is stupid . everything in paris is stupid . constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in france knows how to have sex properly . reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what 's `` wrong '' with everyone except c. and m. , one might easily conclude that constance does n't really seem happier now that she 's sleeping with the gamekeeper , and hilda does seem happier in venice - the author counters this by ridiculing `` that kind '' of happiness as delusional and druglike . he even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there 's something wrong with her . of course constance is wretched , because she does not have that one thing that , in lawrence 's view , really matters in life - not mellors , but mellors ' equipment . this book does degenerate into phallus-worship , which makes the author 's hostility toward `` druglike '' pleasures seem sort of ironically comical . hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures : from venice , from the feel of the sun , from jazz , from dancing . this seems weird to me - as if lawrence is punishing the uppity woman . hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a `` user '' , with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man , only to walk away when the dance is over . ( this may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist , since obviously lawrence does n't mind if mellors is callous and behaves as a `` user '' . ) it 's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one 's body . everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex , but his notion of real sex . this is where astute readers will have the most trouble . lawrence clearly defines a `` real '' woman - constance chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples . a woman who lays there `` unfeeling '' is clearly an example . such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc . lawrence does n't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or is n't doing could even be related ; it 's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically , but in character . on the other hand , a woman with an unfeminine urge to be in control - that is , one who insists on moving herself , rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when michaelis is the male ( because he 's premature , and meant to be pathetic ) , but it turns unforgiveable when it 's women in general and especially mellor 's bertha , who just refused to come when she should out of spite . bertha just had a sick ( ! ) urge to be in control , demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature . the only thing mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he `` spoilt '' her . as for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy ? forget it . lawrence suggests that mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch , but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental , nothing important . a real woman does n't need foreplay . just hop on and go , and if she 's what she ought to be , she 'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later . these were what i found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman 's duty is to lie there , not too passive , but not too active , and come when she 's supposed to ( and if she does n't , it 's her own fault ) ; while a man 's job is to climb on top and `` perform '' . all of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are , unfortunately , not true . the truth is that a woman 's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis ; there 's a thing that both males and females start out with , which in a man becomes the penis , and in the woman becomes ( or remains ) a clitoris . lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part . women have always known about their own bodies ; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things , preferably apart from what women think men `` want to hear '' . this , too , is no doubt why it has been accused of being `` sexist '' . the author ( or at least mellors ) openly blames women who can not or will not `` come to the crisis '' when she ought , as if it were entirely of the woman 's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man . it 's also likely that science will eventually prove ( if it has n't already ) that women like constance chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be ' emotionally as well as physically . for all that lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly , even noxious emotions and desires - such as `` intimacy '' and `` connection '' , both of which he has constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act , but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences , based on the notion that a man 's biological job is to get his dna out there , while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment . if this is true , it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant , not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child . so - while there may or may not be women who feel as constance does , at the same time it 's not so clearly obvious that a woman `` should '' feel that way , as to justify lawrence 's open belittling of women whose emotional states do n't match masculine emotional detachment and distance . there 's a lot of talk of `` tenderness '' - in fact , constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in venice of somehow `` lacking tenderness '' - but quite frankly i am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender . the only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her , but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find . i can imagine a woman putting up with - but i can not imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk , who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal ( remembering she 's a lady ) when she asks him questions , who calls her c -- t as if that were her name , and generally treats her as if she were a whore . i could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of , but this is how their relationship really is ; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he wo n't say and the questions he wo n't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible . for what it 's worth , i think life will be better when this book has become obsolete . it is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages , if not their selves . those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion . as for those who just want a good read - i 'd call it a matter of personal taste . obviously some people enjoy this book .

'' ( nash , xxviii ) nash bemoans how the `` great men '' still `` dominate the master narrative [ of the american revolution , ] '' ( nash , xv ) and that we are struck with `` historical amnesia , '' ( nash , xvi ) because we forgot the stories of those outside of the `` great men '' clique . he states that we can not capture the essence of the revolution without paying close attention to the experiences of the many groups that made up colonial society . these groups not only include the poor farmers , artisans , and other laborers , but also of women , blacks ( both free and slave ) , and of the amerindian population . nash illustrated the problems and plights of the lower order through their myriad of stories . to illustrate the importance of the lower classes of white society , he showed the importance of these individuals in their role as revolutionaries , which include their participation in riots against the various taxes implemented by the parliament . he also shows the tensions between the seaboard inhabitants and their piedmont antithesis to the west which , in his estimation , helped to spur change all along the way . in the case of the inhabitants of what would become vermont , he illuminated their fight against the landowners located primarily in new york city . led by ethan allen , the `` green mountain boys , '' as they would become known as , fought to keep the land that they cultivated with their own hands - against the wishes and land deeds that the new york city landowners had for their property . ( nash , 110 - 114 ) he also showed how the piedmont inhabitants of the carolinas had to struggle for their rights to live life as they saw fit as well . ( nash , 73 - 79 ) in the case of the `` green mountain boys , '' their struggle proved to be more successful than the struggle of the carolina piedmont , whose insurrection was brutally suppressed by then colonial governor of north carolina , william tryon . nash also shows how this sector of the population became mobilized politically during the course of the revolution . in nash 's estimation , these people were spurred on by the rhetoric of equality in society , as championed by the founding fathers in the countless tracts and pamphlets that were produced during the revolutionary war era . in pennsylvania , the 1776 state constitution was heralded by nash as a true revolutionary document because of its unicameral legislature , its weak executive , and its attempt to limit an amassing of wealth within the state . he also praised the fact that artisans and lower sorts also played such a vital role in the forming of the new state constitution . ( nash , 271 - 286 ) in states where the constitution did adhere to these premises , nash equated it with a betrayal of the will of the people , as evident by the problems massachusetts had in ratifying their state constitution because of its more conservative outlook . ( nash , 302 - 304 ) the talk of freedom and equality also spread , according to nash , to the black population in the american colonies . these ideals not only spread to the free black portion of the population , but also to the thousands of enslaved blacks throughout the land . this spread of ideas to the black population , particularly the enslaved portion , troubled white leaders , according to nash ( nash , 59 ) what was more troubling to the white slave owners was their perception that slave restlessness and even revolt was on the rise . ( nash , 37 - 39 ) what else was truly troubling to many slave holders was that the british actively recruited the slaves to fight against their masters - and all other rebels to the british crown . ( nash , 157 - 164 ) nash contributed much of the awareness of the enslaved to their plight the rise rising literature of freedom that the founding fathers were disseminating across the land . nash believes that this rhetoric , and its implications , were inescapable to the slaves . ( nash , 64 ) he also showed us the aftermath of the revolution for those slaves who sided with the british ; they were transported off either to nova scotia or to the caribbean islands where they were subjected to an even harsher form of slavery than on the mainland . ( nash , 426 - 427 ) women also were praised in this work , as nash pointed out how crucial this sector of the population was throughout the course of the conflict . first , women were important to execute the boycotts that were prevalent in the preceding years of the revolution . nash argued that without their co-operation in the boycotts , the measures would not have proved effective . this is because women had a great deal of involvement in the running of the household and much of the purchasing power was in their hands . if they did not adhere to the boycotts , the measure would have failed , in nash 's estimation . ( nash , 141 - 144 ) nash also illustrated how the women of the revolution became active during the war , specifically in response to rising prices for necessities . nash showed us the response of many women in the boston area to thomas boylston , a merchant whose prices on goods rose as the war progressed . in response to these rising prices , women marched on boylston 's shop , and the shops of other merchants throughout the colonies , to procure the basic necessities for their families at what they deemed equitable prices . ( nash , 232 - 235 ) the plight of the american indians was also great as land speculators and land hungry colonists swarmed over the appalachian mountain range to claim and settle upon lands that were seen as belonging to various indian nations . nash showed us how the natives resisted this encroachment upon their lands through a myriad of tactics , from essentially engaging in bushwhacking warfare with the colonists who encroached upon their lands , ( nash , 253 - 255 ) to the fact that many indian nations chose to align themselves with the british in their cause to suppress the rebellion . ( nash , 151 - 157 ) what was more alarming to nash is the colonists ' `` genocidal '' policies towards the native population . ( nash , 377 - 381 ) although it may not seem like it , there is an underlying premise to nash 's illustrations in the struggles of all of the aforementioned groups during the american revolution . that premise with nash , at first alluded to , and then by the end of the book , states bluntly is class warfare . there is , however , a very real problem in this marxist outlook on american society during the era of the revolution , specifically that the colonists did not view the class structure in the same light that we do today , or even as class was viewed in when karl marx wrote his tracts on such matters . as gordon wood pointed out in his work , the radicalism of the american revolution , `` the social distinctions and economic deprivations that we today think of as the consequence of class divisions , business exploitation , or various isms - capitalism , racism , etc . - were in the eighteenth century usually thought to be caused by the abuses of government . '' ( wood , 5 ) wood also pointed out that there were complexities and variations to american society , which fell along `` local , regional , sectional , ethnic and class differences . '' these complexities made , `` any generalization about americans as a whole , '' quite difficult . ( wood , 6 ) wood further illuminated the difficulties of following such a class distinction as nash proposed in his work . wood stated in his review on nash 's work in the `` new republic online '' : nash 's evidence for popular resistance to all this class exploitation is the incidents of rural rioting and urban mobbing that took place in the decade or so leading up to the revolution . this mobbing and rioting is exceedingly familiar to historians , who have produced a literature about it . unfortunately , these phenomena do not support nash 's argument . not only did the rural rioting have little or nothing to do with the revolution , but the urban mobs , which were indeed directed at british authority , did not represent the class upheaval that nash assumes . the rural riots all arose out of peculiar local circumstances , and were hardly expressions of some sort of coherent class warfare . ( wood , `` new republic online review ) wood , in his review of nash 's work , went on to illustrate exactly what constituted the true dividing lines in american society when he stated : but what of all the rhetoric about the laboring people contesting the aristocratic few that nash draws on to make his case for class warfare ? there was indeed a serious division in eighteenth-century american society that reverberated through the northern states over the succeeding decades , but it was not the one that nash describes . instead of being divided between a rich upper class and a poor working class , as nash sees it , anachronistically anticipating a later nineteenth-century division between employers and employees , eighteenth-century american society was in fact still divided between a leisured gentry and the mass of artisans and other laborers who worked with their hands -- many of them the businessmen of the future . in nash 's work , he viewed many of the revolutionaries as having ulterior motives for their proclamations of equality and freedom . nash , i would argue , hinted toward the idea that the founding fathers only took part in the revolutionary movement to benefit themselves . throughout the course of the book , nash takes great care to `` expose '' the double standards of the founding fathers , making them seem as if they merely wanted to continue their `` elitists '' lifestyle at the expense of the commoners below . there is no bigger whipping boy for nash than john adams , who , according to nash , was essentially a closeted monarchist who was afraid of the people . to be sure , adams did have his reservations about the people , but it was more a fear of a `` tyranny of the masses '' than it was an outright fear that the people would displace the leaders of the new nation . however , what is truly ironic is that nash relied so heavily upon the writings of john adams to illustrate many of his points . not only did he rely on adams ' writings , but also the writings of many of the other founding fathers . throughout the course of the book , when nash referred to any of the writings of the founding fathers , i found myself wondering if nash was cropping their words to support his case . it is my belief that this is something that seriously needs to be explored in greater depth than i can provide here . what is also ironic is that nash makes little use of the narratives of those whose stories he claimed he wanted to tell . outside of the use of joseph plumb martin 's narrative of his experiences as a soldier in the continental army during the war and the autobiography of ethan allen , he does not make extensive use of the diaries and letters of many people who lived through the war experience , both in the military and in the civilian sector . to be sure , there are many diaries out there from those below who can illuminate their thoughts throughout the era . would their writings bear out what nash proposed ? nash criticized the continental congress for not being able to pay the soldiers their salaries . this inability to pay the soldiers wages stemmed from the fact that the government was essentially broke : they were unable to levy taxes on the people of the colonies because of the weak governmental structure from which they operated and many of the colonies did not pay their fair share of the financial burden of the revolution . when robert morris tried to restore fiscal responsibility to the war effort and raise revenue to provide pay and necessities to the army , nash viewed it as an attempt to `` tame the social and political radicalism of the revolution . '' ( nash , 367 ) however , i suppose nash chose to forget the fact that morris was trying to get revenue to provide for the war effort . why then would thomas paine , one who nash seemed to have great respect for his principles of democracy , agreed to author a pamphlet on behalf of robert morris in favor of his new fiscal plan . ( nash , 395 ) if morris ' plan was so stifling to democracy , intended to roll back the radicalism of the revolution , then why would paine agree to be a party to it ? not all of these explanations and questions would mesh well with nash 's outlook on morris and the founding fathers at large . further , if the founding fathers truly wanted rule for themselves , there was no better chance for one of them to establish it than with the `` newburgh conspiracy . '' it is true that the soldiers and officers of george washington 's army were deeply distraught by the ineffectual abilities of the congress to pay wages and provide for basic necessities . ( nash , 370 - 371 ) however , what nash failed to mention is the other half of the conspiracy . the men wanted to march on the continental congress and put george washington in power . washington , through an impassioned speech and performance , quelled all of these thoughts and possibly saved the revolution once again . nash , as stated previously , believed the struggle of the thousands of black slaves in the colonies was heightened by the revolutionary rhetoric that littered the landscape of the era . he believed that such literature raised their awareness and caused more unrest and rebellion than at any time previously . however , i would like to offer my own take on this . did it take pamphlets from the founding fathers to raise the awareness of the enslaved that there was something unnatural about their situation ? i certainly think not . frederick douglass ' autobiography indicates that from a very early age , he was well aware that there was something wrong with the situation he found himself . in an illustration , a still teenage douglass talked with some of his young white friends on the streets of baltimore and they complained about their lot in life . douglass illustrated the point when he wrote , `` you will be free as soon as you are twenty-one , but i am a slave for life ! '' ( douglass , 53 ) while douglass certainly is an exceptional individual , i doubt that this same premise was lost on the countless enslaved individuals in the colonies and that they wanted freedom and it did not take pamphlets for that realization to come to mind . nash lamented the `` genocidal policies '' towards the amerindians adopted by many colonists during the revolution . while it is true that atrocities were committed against the natives , first , this was nothing new by this point in american history . warfare between the natives and colonists was an almost constant from the time that european settlers stepped onto the new world . in such a climate , atrocities committed by both sides in this armed and almost perpetual struggle were inevitable . however , nash is somewhat disingenuous when he makes the native population seemingly innocent or justified in their actions . although nash admitted that the british courted and armed the native peoples to fight the colonists , even after the revolution was over , he can not seem to find any justification for the colonists to meet force with force . lastly , as stated previously , nash bemoaned how historians and the people at large have lost the viewpoint of those below the founding fathers - how the great men still consistently dominant the narrative on the american revolution . ( nash , xv ) first , i would ask mr. nash , `` should we discount what the `great men ' did during the war ? '' while historians do deal with the `` great men '' of the american revolution , i doubt there is one serious historian out there who would discount the actions and sacrifices that were made by the people below . their deeds do not go unnoticed in narratives of the war . we read about the boston tea party , we read about the non-importation of british goods and how the participation of the common people was vital to such an enterprise . we read about the plight of the continental soldier as they nearly starve and free to death in the service of their country . what nash further discounted was the explosion over the past decades in dealing with various social aspects of the history of the revolution . bruce chadwick 's piece , the first american army : the soldiers of the american revolution , he offered the reader a look into the world of the solider in the continental army through their diaries , letters and records . through these written records , we are presented with the bleak situation that so many found themselves in - conflicting interests between home and duty , the want of food and clothing , and their battle experiences . alfred young , in the shoemaker and the tea party , offers a glimpse into the world of the common man on the streets , taking part in demonstrations and actions against the british and their oppressive measures . women 's roles in the revolution are far from ignored . mary beth norton authored a book , liberty 's daughter 's : the revolutionary experience of women : 1750 -1800 , dealing specifically with the trials and tribulations of the women during the american revolution , both from the patriot side and the loyalist side . linda kerber also wrote a piece on women in the american revolution entitled , women of the republic : intellect and ideology in revolutionary america , which also draws upon the revolutionary experience of women through their diaries , letters and legal papers . the native americans receive their fair share of print as well . alan taylor wrote divided ground : indians , settlers , and the northern borderland of the american revolution , which offers a rich , sprawling history focusing on the iroquois six nations of new york and upper canada during the era of the american revolution . taylor examines indians ' wise but unsuccessful attempts to hold onto their land as colonists encroached on it . colin calloway , in his work , the american revolution in indian country : crisis and diversity in native american communities , explored the internal strife that the revolution brought to indian nations involved with the american revolution . the african-american population in the revolutionary era also received a fair amount of print about their ordeals . glenn knoblock wrote , strong and brave fellows : new hampshire 's black soldiers and sailors of the american revolution : 1775 - 1784 , which explored the military careers of over 200 black military officers during the american revolution and attempted to reconstruct their ordeal throughout the conflict . sylvia frey , in her book , water from a rock : black resistance in a revolutionary age , explored the triangular relationship between the british , the americans , and slaves in the south . through this triangular relationship , frey attempted to illustrate the complex and confusing options presented to the slaves in the south during the rebellion . beyond the founders : new approaches to the political history of the early american republic , edited by jeffrey palsey offers readers an alternative reading in the same light that nash presents , the conflicting desires of the myriad of peoples during the american revolution . the political historians contained in this work showed that the early history of the united states was not just the product of a few `` founding fathers , '' but was also marked by widespread and passionate popular involvement ; print media more politically potent than that of later eras ; and political conflicts and influences that crossed lines of race , gender , and class . thus , this work is not beholden to one particular point of view on the revolution , as nash is guilty of being caught up in . these are just some of the books out there on the myriad of topics that nash covered and , to be sure , there are many more . these books are not hard to find . just do a search on amazon 's or barnes and noble 's online stores on any of these topics and you will be presented with a cornucopia of choices - there is not quite the neglect that nash claimed in these fields . to be sure , there will still be authors who write biographies on the `` great men '' of the american revolution , but there are many who also explore the social history of the conflict . thus , nash is not the lone voice for these `` forgotten '' as he claimed"}, {"num": 1659, "context": "do n't fail to read this if you 're new to earth in today 's world , various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism . these forms of parochialism may be ethnic , `` cultural , '' religious , nationalistic , etc. , depending on where you look . on one hand , ancient forms of identity continue to define in-groups and out-groups ;

'' this has happened in some countries in order to respond better to many needs and demands , by remedying forms of poverty and deprivation unworthy of the human person . however , excesses and abuses , especially in recent years , have provoked very harsh criticisms of the welfare state , dubbed the `` social assistance state . '' malfunctions and defects in the social assistance state are the result of an inadequate understanding of the tasks proper to the state . here again the principle of subsidiarity must be respected : a community of a higher order should not interfere in the internal life of a community of a lower order , depriving the latter of its functions , but rather should support it in case of need and help to coordinate its activity with the activities of the rest of society , always with a view to the common good . by intervening directly and depriving society of its responsibility , the social assistance state leads to a loss of human energies and an inordinate increase of public agencies , which are dominated more by bureaucratic ways of thinking than by concern for serving their clients , and which are accompanied by an enormous increase in spending . in fact , it would appear that needs are best understood and satisfied by people who are closest to them and who act as neighbors to those in need . it should be added that certain kinds of demands often call for a response which is not simply material but which is capable of perceiving the deeper human need . one thinks of the condition of refugees , immigrants , the elderly , the sick , and all those in circumstances which call for assistance , such as drug abusers : all these people can be helped effectively only by those who offer them genuine fraternal support , in addition to the necessary care .

'' he found out how caleb loved music . he also went searching to caleb 's home in baltimore . then the private investigator learned where caleb was just outside of new orleans , louisiana . the private investigator told the pecks this but before daniel could meet caleb , daniel died of a heart attack . this book was draining yet funny ; mostly draining . the hardest part was keeping track of what part the story was in , whether the past or the present . also the peck family was absolutely insane . actually two cousins ended up married to each other . that caused so much chaos that a separation , a disowning and a suicide happened over the event . then justine and duncan were constantly moving because duncan would become restless and wanted a change . justine just went along very easily but meg , their daughter , hated moving . she locked herself in the bathroom a few times . daniel did not begin looking for his brother for practically 30 years after caleb walked out . the comical parts were the best . for instance , all the time that daniel was searching for caleb his old maid knew right where caleb was . when caleb left , he had told her where he was going . yet she never told anyone because no one ever asked her . in addition , duncan would cut out newspaper clippings and stick them to things . to the old ford that the door was torn off he stuck a clipping that said `` would n't you rather have a buick ?

) would be placed in maximum security prison in a matter of a week . i find it hard to believe that on his first day , he would get beaten and practically raped ( i ca n't remember if he was or not ) . i could be wrong , but if 28 years have passed , would n't the statute of limitations passed , and even if they had n't , would n't the mother need to press charges in order for anything to happen ? and would n't it mean something that they were in a different state ? now , even though everyone else seemed to love her , delia was incredibly annoying ( and the actress who read her `` monologues '' in the audio version was equally annoying ) . women authors tend to make their female protagonists characters that supposedly have a lot of depth that usually have several men in love with her . i have seen many women in real life who pretend that they have this effect on men , but rarely ever do . it just seems like a fantasy of picoults , and a very boring one at that . ah , a love triangle , gee , like that 's never been done before . one instance that sticks out is when delia gets upset that eric ( her fiancee and her fathers attorney ) does n't tell her about a court appearing , however , eric did n't even find out until ten minutes before it was about to happen . but , even the premise for that is questionable : would that really happen ? i mean seriously ! i also hated how the book shifted `` voices '' -- this is not a play , i do n't want to read monologues describing the same events from a different perspective . i did n't feel as though it was necessary to divide this book into several characters . i half expected a chapter to be from sophie ( delia 's four year old daughter ) perspective . i could really do without the exaggerated and unrealistic jail scenes or the indian lore . i also hated how the entire book seemed to be composed of different memories or thoughts that really made no sense , and then later incorporated into the passage , also not making sense . for example , eric narrates this dream he had about sondra , who is some beautiful girl he imagined . she turns into a rabbit and runs into a bush . later , ruthann tells a story about a rabbit that shoots the sun with a bow and arrow and causes the earth to burn up . somehow he connects the two because of the rabbit , when really they have no cohesive connection . also , between the three childhood friends ( delia , eric and fitz ) they talk about their memories constantly , as if that is the only thing that binds them together . real friendships do n't compromise of only discussing things that happened to them in the past ... but it does in this book , because the author so desperately wants you to know that they are a really close group of friends . to me , it just seems pretentious . what 's also pretentious is the various passages that are supposed to reveal some new idea about life but really make no sense at all . one passage i remember is when delia is talking to fitz about memories and she suggests that maybe everyone has the same memories already in the head from when they are born , and maybe they remember things that never happened to them . i might have that a little wrong , because it 's a bit confusing . it 's confusing because it makes absolutely no sense . it does n't even feel like it 's remotely trying to make sense at all ! the book is full of little things like this that just feel pseudo-intellectual , like picoult is forcing her characters to have depth when they really want to be stereotypical . all of the characters seem a little edgy and totally basket cases . delia gets incredibly upset for not remembering what her life was when she was four years old . for goodness sakes woman , i have maybe 2 or 3 memories from when i was four years old or younger , and most of them do n't make sense except for the fact that i know what my parents have told me . by the way she acts , you 'd think she was 12 when she was kidnapped . also , she seems to recover memories all the time ... man , i wish i could do that . it just seems a bit implausible , that 's all . the book is saturated in gooey , sappy imagery , metaphors , anecdotes , memories , subplots , and so on . i am not so quick to totally bash an author , but it 's this type of pretentious writernese dribble that i loathe . if i wanted some sappy , melodramatic dimestore paperback i would have read one of those instead . i expected better from the synopsis on the back cover . overall , and i say overall without even finishing the book ( i have n't even gotten to the meth lab part with the father yet , but it sounds pretty ridiculous ) , that this is definitely one of the most horrible books i 've ever read , bar none . do yourself a favor and skip this one ... and definitely do n't pick up the audiobook . the voice actors and actresses are incredibly annoying to listen to"}, {"num": 1787, "context": "poetry in riis ' how he oher half lives how the other half lives was written over a century ago as an expose ' of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of new york city . the author speaks with a crusader 's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements , these streets , and these people as if they were living today . this is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men , the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of new york city in the late 1800s . he so graphically describes the filth , the sunless and airless rooms , the crowding , and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart . riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people 's plight . his pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery . he , for the most part , blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions : `` how shall the love of god be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man . '' ( p. 266 ) . he laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor . then , after his extensive discourse , he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions , something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers . riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says , `` if this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice , it has served its purpose . '' the author apparently succeeded with his purpose , because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us : `` this book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major u. s . cities . '' how does this book relate to adult education ? by moving chronologically from the founding of america to the slums of nyc in the 1800s , are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years ? certainly riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem . `` thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education , all the more urgent because these people are poor , miserably poor almost to a man . '' ( p. 147 ) . he does not forget that this `` education '' is not only for the poor people , but also for the wealthy landlords . `` clearly , it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant . '' ( p. 270 ) . riis ' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity . `` it is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society . '' ( p. 233 ) . the relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society . although this book was exhaustive in its detail , it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening . i found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that riis used for the different races . in a sense it reads like a ginsberg poem ; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era . read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm : jewtown , bandit 's roost , double alley , the bowery , the bloody sixth ward , the fourth , fifth and tenth wards , blindman 's alley , the bend , the battery , little italy , the french quarter , hell 's kitchen , the west side , bottle alley , frog hollow , poverty gap , murderer 's alley , gotham court , the old brewery , old africa , potter 's field , blackwell 's island asylum , rogues ' gallery , penitentiary row , chinatown . the list goes on . to someone reared in rural america , this chant sounds like a song about another country . riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of new york city : chinaman ( he ca n't be taught ) , ( chinese ( coolie -- laundry business ) , polish jew ( coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling ) , russian jew , jew ( money is their god ) , bohemian ( poor , but thrifty ) , blacks ( like to gamble , but they are clean ) , greek , hebrews ( tailors , all of them ) , dutchman , irish ( like to drink and have expensive funerals ) , german ( order loving ) , swiss , pasquales , russian , italian ( a born gambler ; lighthearted and gay ) , swamp angel ( thieves ) , street arabs ( army of homeless boys ) , tramps and toughs ( the world owes them a living ) , and the celtics . i was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and riis ' comments about every race . i noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day . riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday . i hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days . does every generation think that is happening in their time ? not only should this book be used by people researching new york city`s tenements , but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change . it is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man 's greed overrides his concern for human dignity ."}, {"num": 1789, "context": "ok for the beginner - but even then not that great i was given this book for

idea that its all about whiny teenagers wearing black and griping about their latent vampire powers through bad poetry . no , palahniuk writes a different kind of book without all of the grim color and stale mythology , but he maintains the same themes : deterioration of the human condition , lack of moral fiber in today 's society , and the danker recesses of the human psyche . survivor tackles these topics with dazzling success and even enters a few new contenders to the mix such as commercialism , consumerism , and materialism . and this is all very old news to absolutely everybody but me , because chuck palahniuk has been around for a while now . it was only until recently i decided to pick up one of his paperbacks at the suggestion of my thugish top 8 myspace friend with too much facial hair and the clown tattoo . now , the way i like my stories told is with a good opening page , a large use of style , and a frugal use on the words . typically , i do n't read too many novels over 300 pages long . i have read plenty of longer books in the past , and all too often the only thing that separates a long story from a short one is that the author of a short book knows how to consolidate his word use and when to shut up . i 'm happy to say chuck palahniuk is such a writer by all counts . like any good stylist , his words flow like water straight from the page into your brain as the protagonist 's situation is fleshed out . survivor opens in the first person with a single man on a plane preparing to crash into the australian outback . he 's the last surviving member of a death cult who has made some strange decisions ... some better than others . at this time he is known the world over as a great spiritual leader , anti christ figure , and media mogul . there are many misconceptions about who he is and why he 's on said death plane , and he 'd like to set the record straight with the help of the jets black box . and from there we meet the narrator , tender branson , now in the past tense and living in humble times as a religious servant . members from his cult are killing themselves left and right , so the government gives branson his own psychotherapist and puts him on suicide watch . but branson is way past believing anything the church filled his mind with , and is more interested in telling other people to kill themselves after they find one of his phony suicide hotline numbers stuck to the side of a bus stop . he works for a couple that is very well off , and through his years of service has accumulated a library 's worth of useful housekeeping tips . the reader is educated , in detail , how to properly remove tear stains from pillow cases , urine from drapes , bullet holes in walls , and blood from fur coats . everyday situations are presented from the most warped of perspectives , and depending on the readers attitude , this may either be disturbing or refreshing . example : is learning that everyone you love will someday die from owning and loving upwards of six hundred pet goldfishes that have all died strike you as ironic , or sad ? are you intrigued by romances sparked in a cemetery , or turned off ? how about an over analytic shrink who convinces a hypochondriac that he has multiple problems in an attempt identify and cure just one ? clever , or whatever ? if you 're leaning towards the former with any of these , i might have an author to recommend . the characters are wonderful , and i took to them like a kid to a black van with candy . they have no need for convention . they have their own means of courtship , their own philosophies forged in solitude and cynicism , their own reasons for being attracted to someone else , and their own reasons for living and dying . but none of this is to say that everything is mentos and diet coke . while i 've never read another palahniuk book , i have seen fight club , a filmed adaptation if his book , and the voice of the protagonist in that story is very similar to the voice in this one . i could n't even read a sentence here without hearing edward norton 's voice , so similar were the personalities . both had a very sardonic tone towards everything modern and cynical one liners about the status quo . sloppy , but ill let it pass . did i mention that everything i just said only applies to the first half of the book ? the second half falls to pieces and leaves what could have been over arching themes or meanings in smouldering shambles . it 's a shame really . the first one hundred and fifty pages of survivor read very much like something i might very well write ten years from now , whereas the second half was more like the rough draft of something i could write now . character actions break the bank of plausibility and some scenes read like the author is trying to beat you over the head with some point that you just ca n't make out . for a book that started out so strong , i was left with a story that ultimately delivered nothing but the comical and poignant one liners it offered along the way . but hey , that 's life , is n't it ? well sure , its life , and its shaggy dog story telling too , but read both halves and tell me that something wasnt wasted from the first one . threads were coming together . if the book had stayed on course all the way through , i 'd be using this review to announce chuck palahniuk as my new favorite author , and maybe survivor as a favorite book . unfortunately , the second half was so lacking , i can barely recommend it as a whole . but there 's no reason that good writing should go to waste . use the first two chapters here to qualify yourself for all of palahniuk 's writings . you can do it in one sitting and be introduced to a wonderful mind and voice . from there you can hopscotch the palahniuk library with some assurance that everything will be a-ok in your tragedy of choice ."}, {"num": 1810, "context": "smart dogs , dumb authors i could n't even begin

they ca n't tell the difference between a tug toy and human skin . the first is clearly way beyond a dog 's capacity , while the second is something which comes totally natural to them . how did coren get things so backwards ? and the `` intelligence '' tests he provides have nothing to do with intelligence but in how focused or driven a dog is to do the test ( or game ) while you 're doing it . for instance , i tried one of the tests with my dog by putting a piece of food under a towel , then waited to see how long it took him to find the treat . i 'd still be waiting if i had n't decided he 'd never look under that towel . then i tried the same game by teasing my dog with one of his favorite toys . then i hid it under the towel , and it took him less than a second to get that toy . so my dog is apparently both on the smarter and dumber ends of coren 's intelligence spectrum . ( this is just one example , by the way : the whole idea of testing a dog 's iq like this is bogus . ) and do n't get me started on coren 's pedantic retelling of the alpha myth . granted , he wrote this book before the latest research on wild wolf packs proved that there 's no such thing as a dominance hierarchy , or an alpha wolf , or the rest of that alpha nonsense . though , i doubt if even that data would change coren 's mind . after all , he seriously recommends rolling your dog over on its back every day and pulling one of the animal 's hind legs in the air to create a posture which supposedly `` signifies submission to the pack leader . '' ( really ? dogs use `` signifiers '' now ? ) the funny thing is , shortly after reading that passage i saw a wolf documentary on tv and the papa wolf did the exact opposite or what coren recommends ! he rolled over on his back and let the pups jump on top of him and bite his nose ! they loved it ! so i tried what the papa wolf did with his pups with my dog -- an alpha male , if there ever was one -- and he loved it . and later that night , on our last walk , he was ten times as obedient to me than he had been before i 'd mimicked the papa wolf 's behavior . again , coren had everything exactly backwards to reality . this `` through the looking glass '' quality persists throughout the book , with coren even saying that dogs are capable of hypothetical , symbolic , and conceptual thinking . wha.. ?

( 2 ) author writes : `` i see the bible as human response to god . rather than seeing god as scriptures 's ultimate author ... . the bible thus tells us about how they saw things , not about how god sees things .

'' author ignored the words of the holy spirit spoken through king solomon , son of david , wherein he writes : `` if you will turn to my reproof , behold , i will pour out my spirit upon you ; i will make known my words to you ( proverbs 1:23 . ) '' in my view , author of the book while thinking within himself that he is wise , he became fool ( romans 1:22. ) . ( 3 ) let me illustrate author 's foolishness with another blasphemy . he writes : `` but a moment 's reflection suggests that the ten commandments are also a human product and written from a male point of view.

'' . `` verily it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than , after they have known it , to turn from the holy commandment that was delivered to them . '' author 's contempt for the holy scriptures can be traced to his upbringing in the lutheran church . he says : `` i was nurtured in the the lutheran church and remained lutheran until about age 30 . '' luther is not much of a roll model for anything . it is luther who showed contempt for the holy scriptures when he called book of james , `` an epistle of straw '' . luther called book of revelation , `` worthless '' . talk about having an arrogant and audacious attitude . lord eshoo messiah said `` unless we become like little children we can not enter the kingdom of god '' . by that , my savior did not mean at all that we should be childish . what he talks about is having child like trust . book of psalms tells that `` he teaches humble his way '' . and `` fear of god is the beginning of wisdom but fool despise wisdom and instruction . '' to such self appointed reformers and professors , holy spirit had issued following warning in the epistle of james : james 3:1 `` let not many of you become teachers , my brethren , knowing that as such we will incur a stricter judgment . '' luther should have kept himself busy studying god 's word instead of writing the anti-jewish tripe , `` jews and their lies '' . this book came in very handy for hitler who sent 6 millions of the seed of abraham ( jews ) to their death in holocaust - pan european event . 6th commandment , which is law of god says : `` thou shall not kill or murder '' holy scriptures says that like cloud and wind without rain is man who boast of his gift falsely . neither luther nor the author possess the gift of teaching . i am convinced that there was no reformation . things have not changed at all . in rome we have one pope on seven hills . protestant movement has produced seven popes on every dunghill ( western and eastern churches ) . lord eshoo during his earthly ministry did not speak of reformations or revivals , but instead said : `` because of the growh of iniquity ( lawlessness ) love of many will grow cold . will son of man find faith when he returns ? '' i want to cry out : help lord , godly men ceases to be , and faith has disappeared from the earth '' let me end my review with the following words of encouragement as well as warning given by the holy spirit : proverbs 30 : 5-6 `` every word of god is pure ; he is a shiled to those who put their trust in him . do not add to his words ; lest he reprove you , and you be found a liar .

' the big problem i found is that even when groothuis offers defensible criticisms , his alternatives end up being just as problematic as the positions he criticizes . for all his advocacy for a correspondence theory of truth , his tone betrays a penchant for certainty and formal coherence . he falls into the problem of the relation between thought and `reality , ' representation to presentation , the role of language , and so forth . no doubt god comes to save the day with all these problems , yet on the very justificatory terms groothuis advocates for , god escapes the measure of correspondence and becomes its condition of possibility . in other words , god becomes a structural metaphysical function which `saves ' groothuis 's truth from the skeptic . the problem , however , is that groothuis wants truth to be absolute , universal , and accessible to all , yet he is dependent on a moment ( i.e . faith ) which , by definition , retains a trace of contingency or `objective ' undecidability . groothuis 's more ethical concerns are where i am more sympathetic , but again , here his polemics and non-reading of the people he criticizes drowned out whatever constructive points he offers . groothuis practices the same type of irresponsible reflection that some of the `pomo ' evangelical 's do : uncriticality . here , philosophy and reflection - whether modern or postmodern - becomes a means to simply confirm and justify a complacent status quo , rather than challenging and transforming the status quo . the challenge presented in this book is for a nostalgic return to the good old days of christendom . jesus did not come to `save ' our metaphysical systems , but to redeem us and this world . that redemption is not contingent upon accurate representations as groothuis seems to think . it is madness to the greek ( i.e . the logician ) and a stumbling block to the legalist ( i.e . moralistic hypocrites ) . the task is not to make the faith less crazy or more socially repressive . as james tells us , the measure of `true ' faith - and here i will grant a type of reference - is that we `attend to the widow and orphan . ' kerygma without service is dead , a worse lie than any humanism . perhaps if we began `proving ' our faith , that is , manifesting its truth in radical service and justice - we could actually demonstrate the truth to which we testify . i guess it is much easier to `defend the faith ' with bad arguments which only convince the already convinced , than to `live the faith ' : serve the people no one gives a hoot about . after all , in the latter case one can not fancy oneself a hero in quite the same way ."}, {"num": 1938, "context": "unbiblical and bad writing make for one star this book is so flawed in every which way , it is hard to know where to begin . first of all , we are living in the end times , and when jesus comes , that 's all she wrote , folks . there 's no seven years , no christians being zapped up , etc . this is our second chance on earth . no tribulation . this book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally , and does it poorly . reading this book made me think that if this was true , then what 's the point of trying to be a christian . why not just live your life the way you want to , and then when people zap out of thin air , change your life . it 's ridiculous and sends the wrong message . plus , the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it . but i really do n't think the author 's care at this point ( seeing how many millions they 've made printing lies ) . my recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series ; then you 'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter ( and much better writing ) . man , not even kirk cameron could save this train wreck . re : j czecholinski hey j , you could n't be more wrong ! your review is as flawed as lahaye and jenkin 's unbiblical writing . first , i am a christian who does believe that jesus is coming back , but i do not believe he is coming back in a secret , silent rapture that the left behind series is making millions of christians believe . i believe in the verse you used ( to try and prove me wrong ) , which is 1 thessalonians 4:16-17 : 'for the lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout , with the call of the archangel , and with the trumpet call of god . first , all the christians who have died will rise from the graves.then , together with them , we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and remain with him forever . ' when jesus comes back , we will know it . keys words being commanding shout and trumpet call of god . we 're not going to be zapped up while others are standing around for 7 years . in the bible , 7 years refers to completeness or totality , which is time until jesus comes back for good . lahaye and jenkins are taking figurative language from john 's revelation and making them literal and adding their own spin to sell books and make movies . this adding to scripture and polluting the word of god makes me think of galatians 1:6-9 which says : `` i am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of christ and are turning to a different gospel -- which is really no gospel at all . evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of christ . but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you , let him be eternally condemned ! as we have already said , so now i say again : if anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted , let him be eternally condemned ! '' this is what lahaye and jenkins are doing : perverting the gospel with their own spin . and your `` belief '' in the anti-christ is incorrect as well ( along with lahaye and jenkins ) . check out these verses : 1st john 2:22 `` who is the liar ? it is the man who denies that jesus is the christ . such a man is the antichrist -- he denies the father and the son . '' or 1st john 4:3 `` ... but every spirit that does not acknowledge jesus is not from god . this is the spirit of the antichrist , which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world . '' key words their being even now is already in the world . this is referring to satan who was in the world in john 's day and still in the world . the bible says in 1st john 2:18 that many anti-christs have come and anti-christ is anyone who is against christ . there are many people who are persecuting the church and christians ( as this is the last days that we are living - check out 2nd timothy 3 ) . why are we looking for somebody like nicholae when there are already those who have the spirit of the anti-christ ? why are polluting the word of god to try and sell books and movies . why are we allowing ourselves to be eternally condemned because we are starting to follow this new type of thinking ? do you think that the disciples , when jesus ascended to heaven , thought that there would be a silent rapture followed by tribulation ? no ! finally , you said that 2nd corinthians 6:2 says : `` today is the day of salvation i 'm looking so forward to that day when the lord will come for me and all born again believers that we wo n't have to endure the tortures during the tribulation . '' what bible version are you looking at . 2nd corinthians 6:2 clearly states : `` for he says , 'in the time of my favor i heard you , and in the day of salvation i helped you . ' i tell you , now is the time of god 's favor , now is the day of salvation . '' nothing about tribulation and nothing about enduring tortures ! ! ! you are just making up scripture , perverting the gospel ! now verse 4 talks about troubles ( lower-case `` t '' ) , hardships , distresses , etc . that is happening now , today until jesus comes back with a commanding shout and trumpet call of god to take us to heaven and those against him into eternal judgement - no 7 year tribulation period ! ! ! live today like it was your last day , because you could die or jesus could come back ( and believe me , you will know it because until you can show me verses where a silent , secret rapture will take place and there will be those left behind battling for seven years , i will continue to follow the god-breathed word of god and not fluff of lahaye and jenkins . `` tribulation '' is found once in the bible ( rev 7:14 niv ) and it is with a lower-case `` t '' and has nothing to do about what the books suggest . `` rapture '' never appears as this is a word that has n't been around that long . so in summary , jesus is coming back and we will know about it ( whether you are a christian or not ) . and off the subject , yes , baptism is essential to becoming a christian and being saved ( not praying jesus into your heart ) ... it seems that the same people who believe in lahaye 's rapture are usually wrong on that issue as well . please do yourself a favor . read the bible and follow it . if you do that , then you wo n't be led astray by these false teachings of someone like j. czecholinski who can not even get his scriptures straight . re : j. czecholinski wow , j czecholinski 's perverting of the scripture is uncanny . somehow , he has gotten this vision and received a new gospel along with lahaye and jenkins . most of his words are empty , his verses taken out of context , the use of visions in revelation taken literal , and his best response is this : `` this thought process has dominated rapture writings for the past 25 years . '' wow , 25 years ! forgot about centuries of beliefs that the disciples have passed down and jesus 's own words and the scriptures ( again i point to the verses you brought up 1st thessalonians 4:16-17 - loud command and trumpet call of god ! ! ! ) . and then he tries to debate the baptism issue which jesus and the disciples have passed down , but in the last 100 years new thinkers have changed that to just `` pray jesus into your heart '' , although there are many verses about baptism being essential and zero about praying jesus into your heart ( big one being said by peter , a disciple of jesus in acts 2:38 `` peter replied , `` repent and be baptized , every one of you , in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins . and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit . '' then there is : matt 3:11 , john 3 ( water and spirit ! ) , acts 2:41 , acts 8:12-16 , acts 8:36-38 , acts 9:18 , acts 19:3-5 , acts 22:16 , romans 6 , 1 corinthians 12:13 , 1 corinthians 15:29 , galatians 3:27 , ephesians 4:5 , colossians 2:12 , and the list goes on and on although the bible never says to pray him into your heart ! i think the disciple peter said it best in 1st peter 3:18-22 `` for christ died for sins once for all , the righteous for the unrighteous , to bring you to god . he was put to death in the body but made alive by the spirit , through whom also he went and preached to the spirits in prison who disobeyed long ago when god waited patiently in the days of noah while the ark was being built . in it only a few people , eight in all , were saved through water , and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also -- not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward god . it saves you by the resurrection of jesus christ , who has gone into heaven and is at god 's right hand -- with angels , authorities and powers in submission to him . '' do n't try to say that baptism is a good work and compare it to ephesians 2:8 and take it out of context . salvation requires : believe , confess , repent , baptism , and living by your faith . that is the belief that jesus and the apostles have passed down for 2000 years . so j , you can go ahead and listen to thought of the last 25 to 100 years by man , but as for me , i will listen to the scriptures and to jesus and to paul and the apostles . for paul says in galatians 1:12 `` i did not receive it from any man , nor was i taught it ; rather , i received it by revelation from jesus christ .

exchanges . they are called exchanges because the foods in each group can be exchanged with each other and still supply a similar amount of calories , proteins , carbohydrates , fats and other nutrients . `` the official pocket guide to dieabetic exchanges '' is an excellent resource for describing the nature and benefits of the exchanges . i have been a diabetic since the age of 50 . it is certainly easier to use the exchange system then laboriously counting calories and carbohydrates . they give us a short hand method of coming up with close approximations . one thing that can also be of benefit to diabetics is the glycemic index which measures the impact of various carbohydrates on our blood sugar level . glucose is given a value of 100 . all other foods are ranked according to the percentage rise they cause as compared to glucose . for example , apple juice has a glycemic index of 40 . this means that a serving of apple juice containing 25 grams of carbohydrates would cause a blood sugar rise that is 40 percent of that which would be caused by 25 grams of pure glucose . related to the glycemic index is the glycemic load which applied the glycemic index to serving sizes . to calculate the glycemic load the grams of carbohydrates ( less the fiber ) is multiplied by the glycemic index expressed as a percentage . an exchange of apple juice has 15 grams of carbohydrates . multiplying this by 40 % ( glycemic index of 40 ) yields a glycemic load of 6 . now lets compare this to 15 gm of watermelon . watermelon has a glycemic index of 72 which is higher than table sugar . the glycemic load of watermelon is 11 ( 15 x .72 = 11 ) . thus the impact of watermelon on our blood sugar is almost twice for the same level of carbohydrates . fortunately , a half of watermelon only has six grams of carbohydrates as compared to a half cup of apple juice which has 14 . measured on a volume basis the apple juice actually has a higher glycemic impact . no such luck with a baked potato which has a glycemic index of 85 . a half cup of baked potatoes has 38 grams of carbohydrate . this yields a glycemic load of 32 ( 38 x .95 = 32 ) . determining the glycemic impact of foods does require more effort than just counting exchanges . but by getting involved in the details i have been able to lose nearly 80 pounds and am able to manage my blood sugar levels with diet and

'' ( `` complete '' guide to the classical '' ? ... there 's a warning word for you ! ) judging by the numerous 5 star ratings , some people presume to learn from robins ' style of writing and illustrating an art instruction book . moreover , robins subtitles the `` art of figure drawing '' as : `` the complete guide to the classical tradition '' ; well , it is n't ! it is anything but a complete guide to the `` classical tradition '' . in fact , it is exactly the opposite of the `` classical tradition '' for teaching drawing . before purchasing this book , the reader should do a web-search for luca cambiaso ( born 1527 died 1585 ) . luca cambiaso , genoese painter began using simplified cubic shapes as a kind of shorthand drawing style , and is believed to have been the author of the method of dividing the human body into small squares in order to give correct proportions . art authorities believe that rennaissance masters passed `` pattern books '' to their students for study . of these , luca cambiaso 's drawings are about all that remain of these `` block figure '' rough sketches . some of these can be found on the internet , just to give you an idea . at any rate , the point i am making here is that these `` block figures '' [ which jack hamm calls simplified figurettes ] are at the core of the classical tradition . robins fails to include block figure , human puppet , or simplified figurette drawings that must be part of a book referencing the `` classic drawing techniques , '' because such block figures are much represented in books genuinely invested in `` the classic tradition '' . i do not really understand why , but it is quite common today , for authors not following the classical tradition to claim exactly the opposite . they claim to teach the classical tradition , but they do not ? to be blunt , it 's a rip-off of some kind . robins is entirely misleading in his title . rather than being invested in `` the classical tradition '' robins is vested in the `` contemporary perspectives '' approach to figure drawing . classical tradition per se , is more represented in books by walt reed , or jack hamm & edgar loy fankbonner & others where block figure or human puppet drawings , along with intermediate steps for refining rough sketches by degree , make up the real `` classical tradition '' . ( i know i 'm being repetitive here , but i simply insist on making the point ! ) another fundamental flaw in robins method , is that he offers what one amazon book reviewer has termed , `` invisible problem solving , '' whereby the final drawings are shown , avoiding the beginning or intermediate steps which are used to arrive at final drawings . the last manga drawing book i peeked at contained no less than 70 pages ( out of a total of 190 pages ) on human ... ( human , not cartoon , mind you ) anatomy using a honegumi skeleton for illustration . this included basic instruction that any complete guide ought to have : how to draw human eyes , ears ( from front and back view ) , nose , mouth , musculature and bone structure . in this regard , the use of a basic anatomical device such as a honegumi skeleton or `` simplified figurette '' as jack hamm calls them , is fundamental to basic drawing . and this is my criticism of clem robins ; that he has titled his book a `` complete guide '' but it certainly excludes beginning students as a target audience . the price is too high , when there are more thorough guides to human figure drawing still in print for less , some of them published over 50 years ago . mr. robins himself recommends george bridgman to the book buyer , over his own text , so what 's the point anyway ? the point is , that whether by publisher or individual author , the `` how-to-draw '' market is flooded with books that some will buy , confident that they are acquiring the very best of the figure drawing tradition . i would shrink from a purchase that contains an author 's personal caveat emptor ."}], "stamper": [{"num": 1111, "context": "fuzzy-bunny liberalism breaks rank with reality although i agree with several of mr. stamper 's recommendations ( legalizing prostitution , decriminalizing drugs ) , many of his assertions are straight out of the `` i-hate-america '' handbook . all white , male cops -and even many black ones - are racsist , homophobic , women-hating thugs . what we need is a kinder , gentler way of policing . mr. stamper had a brief career as a police officer before his real career of supervisory bureacrat began . he `` confesses '' that in his rookie year he was on his way to becoming one of the bad cops before he was set right by a straight-shootin ' da . it was apparently then that his liberal sensitivities kicked in , and soon he was a supervisor ( all the better to control the average joe ) . the unfortunate thing about this book is n't the stories he relates , or even his recommendations ( some good , some not so good ) , but the haughty way in which he relates it . conservatives , republicans - bad ! liberals , democrats - good !

the animal rights issue is a tricky one , because it touches on really deep questions about what it means to be conscious , to have rights , and to experience suffering . so you might expect a philosopher to be able to sort through the ethical issues and suggest a way forward . if so , you would be disappointed by this book . the first chapter lays out the philosophical foundation of the book . singer argues that there 's really no basis for assigning equal rights to all humans , since different humans have different abilities . therefore equality must be based on the recognition of another person 's interests . since animals have interests too , they deserve equal treatment . that 's it . it 's not terribly deep , and frankly not even rational , but singer does n't bother to elaborate . so if animals have interests , then they obviously have an interest in not suffering . how do we know animals are capable of suffering ? according to singer there are two signs : they seek to avoid painful stimuli and they have nervous systems that bear a superficial similarity to those of humans . he does n't say how he came up with these criteria , but they seem awfully generous to me . in fact , based on those criteria one would conclude that monkeys are capable of understanding spoken language and that humans are capable of echolocation . monkeys do in fact respond to certain vocalizations , and they have all the relevant physiological structures for understanding speech . and humans actually can echolocate ( with a lot of practice ) . the point is that you would never seriously compare human echolocation to bat echolocation , and the ability of monkeys to process speech is negligible relative to that of humans . could this also be true of the capacity for pain and suffering ? i do n't think anyone knows , and singer does n't shed any light on the subject . the next chapter is about animal testing , and a lot of the chapter deals with the use of animals in scientific experiments . this is the weakest part of the book . singer finds some of the most gruesome experiments in science history , and juxtaposes them with out-of-context quotes from the researchers to make it look like the research was useless . he mentions in passing that the vast majority of animal experiments do n't involve pain , but by the end of the chapter he suggests that all medical experimentation should eventually be stopped . part of his justification for ending medical experiments is the notion that such experiments do n't actually contribute to medical or scientific progress . this idea is unfortunately quite common among people who do n't know anything about medicine or science . however it 's completely incorrect , and most of singer 's arguments regarding the scientific value of animal testing have been completely debunked . for example , he continues to exploit the thalidomide tragedy , even though it was already known at the time the book was written that that incident was unrelated to animal testing . in addition to being totally confused about science , singer seems uncomfortable with the scientific method itself . he repeatedly suggests that animal testing should , in the short term , be limited to experiments that will lead to rapid advances in medical treatment . this is like saying you should look for your lost car keys where you left them . science does n't work this way . at one point ( p. 47 ) , singer complains about a series of experiments that were shown `` first to prove a theory , then to disprove the theory , and finally to support modified versions of the original theory . '' this probably sounds ridiculous to a philosopher , but it 's actually a pretty good description of the scientific method . the next chapter deals with factory farming , and here singer is on firmer ground . as in the previous chapter , there 's no philosophy , or even rational discourse . it 's just page after page of description , in this case of the conditions of animals on a large farm . however , in contrast to the chapter on experimentation , the conditions he describes are standard practice for the majority of farm animals . here it would seem that there 's plenty of room for improvement with comparatively minimal consequences for humans ( although i imagine the situation has only gotten worse since the publication of the second edition of the book in 1990 ) . the next chapter deals with vegetarianism , calling for a boycott of meat and dairy products . again the appeal is basically emotional , and if you were moved by the arguments of the preceding chapter , you will presumably find this chapter convincing . curiously singer does n't call for a similar boycott of medicine or medical treatment , even though the argument would be identical . even if you belief that animal experimentation is useless for human medicine , you have to admit that the purchase of such medicine directly pays for more animal research . anyone who 's receiving treatment for cardiac problems or diabetes , or who has ever had surgery , or who takes prescription drugs , is contributing to animal suffering . maybe singer deals with this in another book , but given the chapter on vegetarianism it 's a rather obvious omission . the next chapter is a strangely out of place history of human attitudes toward animals , going back several thousand years . it might have made sense to put this at the beginning of the book , but perhaps his editor was afraid of losing readers . the last chapter talks about some popular animal rights movements and their accomplishments . singer does n't draw any line between violent organizations like the animal liberation front ( which the fbi considers a terrorist organization ) and organizations that actually help animals in a peaceful way ( like the aspca ) . he speaks positively of peta , which in addition to other extremist activities , supports violence and arson . i do n't know why he would do this . ultimately this is a bad book . it trivializes a serious issue by substituting emotional imagery for rational argumentation . the fact is that humans can benefit greatly from actions that adversely affect animals . in the realm of science , there is no serious doubt that the length and quality of human life have been improved through animal testing . with other behaviors , such as meat-eating , the benefits are more subjective and the suffering is probably greater . how we assign weight to these costs and benefits is a very difficult question that singer does n't even attempt to take seriously"}], "woodhouse": [{"num": 1615, "context": "disappointing and overly optimistic well , i 'd love to read a good book by that title and one might even copy the blurb texts and the table of contets of woodhouse 's book - all its weaknesses are in the fine print , so to say . the paradigm wars the title refers to are meant to take place between & quot ; traditional & quot ; ( mechanistic , etc . ) science and & quot ; new age & quot ; ( holistic , etc . ) world views , which present levels of complexity not available to the traditional approaches . no doubt such a war takes place presently ...

'' ( nash , xxviii ) nash bemoans how the `` great men '' still `` dominate the master narrative [ of the american revolution , ] '' ( nash , xv ) and that we are struck with `` historical amnesia , '' ( nash , xvi ) because we forgot the stories of those outside of the `` great men '' clique . he states that we can not capture the essence of the revolution without paying close attention to the experiences of the many groups that made up colonial society . these groups not only include the poor farmers , artisans , and other laborers , but also of women , blacks ( both free and slave ) , and of the amerindian population . nash illustrated the problems and plights of the lower order through their myriad of stories . to illustrate the importance of the lower classes of white society , he showed the importance of these individuals in their role as revolutionaries , which include their participation in riots against the various taxes implemented by the parliament . he also shows the tensions between the seaboard inhabitants and their piedmont antithesis to the west which , in his estimation , helped to spur change all along the way . in the case of the inhabitants of what would become vermont , he illuminated their fight against the landowners located primarily in new york city . led by ethan allen , the `` green mountain boys , '' as they would become known as , fought to keep the land that they cultivated with their own hands - against the wishes and land deeds that the new york city landowners had for their property . ( nash , 110 - 114 ) he also showed how the piedmont inhabitants of the carolinas had to struggle for their rights to live life as they saw fit as well . ( nash , 73 - 79 ) in the case of the `` green mountain boys , '' their struggle proved to be more successful than the struggle of the carolina piedmont , whose insurrection was brutally suppressed by then colonial governor of north carolina , william tryon . nash also shows how this sector of the population became mobilized politically during the course of the revolution . in nash 's estimation , these people were spurred on by the rhetoric of equality in society , as championed by the founding fathers in the countless tracts and pamphlets that were produced during the revolutionary war era . in pennsylvania , the 1776 state constitution was heralded by nash as a true revolutionary document because of its unicameral legislature , its weak executive , and its attempt to limit an amassing of wealth within the state . he also praised the fact that artisans and lower sorts also played such a vital role in the forming of the new state constitution . ( nash , 271 - 286 ) in states where the constitution did adhere to these premises , nash equated it with a betrayal of the will of the people , as evident by the problems massachusetts had in ratifying their state constitution because of its more conservative outlook . ( nash , 302 - 304 ) the talk of freedom and equality also spread , according to nash , to the black population in the american colonies . these ideals not only spread to the free black portion of the population , but also to the thousands of enslaved blacks throughout the land . this spread of ideas to the black population , particularly the enslaved portion , troubled white leaders , according to nash ( nash , 59 ) what was more troubling to the white slave owners was their perception that slave restlessness and even revolt was on the rise . ( nash , 37 - 39 ) what else was truly troubling to many slave holders was that the british actively recruited the slaves to fight against their masters - and all other rebels to the british crown . ( nash , 157 - 164 ) nash contributed much of the awareness of the enslaved to their plight the rise rising literature of freedom that the founding fathers were disseminating across the land . nash believes that this rhetoric , and its implications , were inescapable to the slaves . ( nash , 64 ) he also showed us the aftermath of the revolution for those slaves who sided with the british ; they were transported off either to nova scotia or to the caribbean islands where they were subjected to an even harsher form of slavery than on the mainland . ( nash , 426 - 427 ) women also were praised in this work , as nash pointed out how crucial this sector of the population was throughout the course of the conflict . first , women were important to execute the boycotts that were prevalent in the preceding years of the revolution . nash argued that without their co-operation in the boycotts , the measures would not have proved effective . this is because women had a great deal of involvement in the running of the household and much of the purchasing power was in their hands . if they did not adhere to the boycotts , the measure would have failed , in nash 's estimation . ( nash , 141 - 144 ) nash also illustrated how the women of the revolution became active during the war , specifically in response to rising prices for necessities . nash showed us the response of many women in the boston area to thomas boylston , a merchant whose prices on goods rose as the war progressed . in response to these rising prices , women marched on boylston 's shop , and the shops of other merchants throughout the colonies , to procure the basic necessities for their families at what they deemed equitable prices . ( nash , 232 - 235 ) the plight of the american indians was also great as land speculators and land hungry colonists swarmed over the appalachian mountain range to claim and settle upon lands that were seen as belonging to various indian nations . nash showed us how the natives resisted this encroachment upon their lands through a myriad of tactics , from essentially engaging in bushwhacking warfare with the colonists who encroached upon their lands , ( nash , 253 - 255 ) to the fact that many indian nations chose to align themselves with the british in their cause to suppress the rebellion . ( nash , 151 - 157 ) what was more alarming to nash is the colonists ' `` genocidal '' policies towards the native population . ( nash , 377 - 381 ) although it may not seem like it , there is an underlying premise to nash 's illustrations in the struggles of all of the aforementioned groups during the american revolution . that premise with nash , at first alluded to , and then by the end of the book , states bluntly is class warfare . there is , however , a very real problem in this marxist outlook on american society during the era of the revolution , specifically that the colonists did not view the class structure in the same light that we do today , or even as class was viewed in when karl marx wrote his tracts on such matters . as gordon wood pointed out in his work , the radicalism of the american revolution , `` the social distinctions and economic deprivations that we today think of as the consequence of class divisions , business exploitation , or various isms - capitalism , racism , etc . - were in the eighteenth century usually thought to be caused by the abuses of government . '' ( wood , 5 ) wood also pointed out that there were complexities and variations to american society , which fell along `` local , regional , sectional , ethnic and class differences . '' these complexities made , `` any generalization about americans as a whole , '' quite difficult . ( wood , 6 ) wood further illuminated the difficulties of following such a class distinction as nash proposed in his work . wood stated in his review on nash 's work in the `` new republic online '' : nash 's evidence for popular resistance to all this class exploitation is the incidents of rural rioting and urban mobbing that took place in the decade or so leading up to the revolution . this mobbing and rioting is exceedingly familiar to historians , who have produced a literature about it . unfortunately , these phenomena do not support nash 's argument . not only did the rural rioting have little or nothing to do with the revolution , but the urban mobs , which were indeed directed at british authority , did not represent the class upheaval that nash assumes . the rural riots all arose out of peculiar local circumstances , and were hardly expressions of some sort of coherent class warfare . ( wood , `` new republic online review ) wood , in his review of nash 's work , went on to illustrate exactly what constituted the true dividing lines in american society when he stated : but what of all the rhetoric about the laboring people contesting the aristocratic few that nash draws on to make his case for class warfare ? there was indeed a serious division in eighteenth-century american society that reverberated through the northern states over the succeeding decades , but it was not the one that nash describes . instead of being divided between a rich upper class and a poor working class , as nash sees it , anachronistically anticipating a later nineteenth-century division between employers and employees , eighteenth-century american society was in fact still divided between a leisured gentry and the mass of artisans and other laborers who worked with their hands -- many of them the businessmen of the future . in nash 's work , he viewed many of the revolutionaries as having ulterior motives for their proclamations of equality and freedom . nash , i would argue , hinted toward the idea that the founding fathers only took part in the revolutionary movement to benefit themselves . throughout the course of the book , nash takes great care to `` expose '' the double standards of the founding fathers , making them seem as if they merely wanted to continue their `` elitists '' lifestyle at the expense of the commoners below . there is no bigger whipping boy for nash than john adams , who , according to nash , was essentially a closeted monarchist who was afraid of the people . to be sure , adams did have his reservations about the people , but it was more a fear of a `` tyranny of the masses '' than it was an outright fear that the people would displace the leaders of the new nation . however , what is truly ironic is that nash relied so heavily upon the writings of john adams to illustrate many of his points . not only did he rely on adams ' writings , but also the writings of many of the other founding fathers . throughout the course of the book , when nash referred to any of the writings of the founding fathers , i found myself wondering if nash was cropping their words to support his case . it is my belief that this is something that seriously needs to be explored in greater depth than i can provide here . what is also ironic is that nash makes little use of the narratives of those whose stories he claimed he wanted to tell . outside of the use of joseph plumb martin 's narrative of his experiences as a soldier in the continental army during the war and the autobiography of ethan allen , he does not make extensive use of the diaries and letters of many people who lived through the war experience , both in the military and in the civilian sector . to be sure , there are many diaries out there from those below who can illuminate their thoughts throughout the era . would their writings bear out what nash proposed ? nash criticized the continental congress for not being able to pay the soldiers their salaries . this inability to pay the soldiers wages stemmed from the fact that the government was essentially broke : they were unable to levy taxes on the people of the colonies because of the weak governmental structure from which they operated and many of the colonies did not pay their fair share of the financial burden of the revolution . when robert morris tried to restore fiscal responsibility to the war effort and raise revenue to provide pay and necessities to the army , nash viewed it as an attempt to `` tame the social and political radicalism of the revolution . '' ( nash , 367 ) however , i suppose nash chose to forget the fact that morris was trying to get revenue to provide for the war effort . why then would thomas paine , one who nash seemed to have great respect for his principles of democracy , agreed to author a pamphlet on behalf of robert morris in favor of his new fiscal plan . ( nash , 395 ) if morris ' plan was so stifling to democracy , intended to roll back the radicalism of the revolution , then why would paine agree to be a party to it ? not all of these explanations and questions would mesh well with nash 's outlook on morris and the founding fathers at large . further , if the founding fathers truly wanted rule for themselves , there was no better chance for one of them to establish it than with the `` newburgh conspiracy . '' it is true that the soldiers and officers of george washington 's army were deeply distraught by the ineffectual abilities of the congress to pay wages and provide for basic necessities . ( nash , 370 - 371 ) however , what nash failed to mention is the other half of the conspiracy . the men wanted to march on the continental congress and put george washington in power . washington , through an impassioned speech and performance , quelled all of these thoughts and possibly saved the revolution once again . nash , as stated previously , believed the struggle of the thousands of black slaves in the colonies was heightened by the revolutionary rhetoric that littered the landscape of the era . he believed that such literature raised their awareness and caused more unrest and rebellion than at any time previously . however , i would like to offer my own take on this . did it take pamphlets from the founding fathers to raise the awareness of the enslaved that there was something unnatural about their situation ? i certainly think not . frederick douglass ' autobiography indicates that from a very early age , he was well aware that there was something wrong with the situation he found himself . in an illustration , a still teenage douglass talked with some of his young white friends on the streets of baltimore and they complained about their lot in life . douglass illustrated the point when he wrote , `` you will be free as soon as you are twenty-one , but i am a slave for life ! '' ( douglass , 53 ) while douglass certainly is an exceptional individual , i doubt that this same premise was lost on the countless enslaved individuals in the colonies and that they wanted freedom and it did not take pamphlets for that realization to come to mind . nash lamented the `` genocidal policies '' towards the amerindians adopted by many colonists during the revolution . while it is true that atrocities were committed against the natives , first , this was nothing new by this point in american history . warfare between the natives and colonists was an almost constant from the time that european settlers stepped onto the new world . in such a climate , atrocities committed by both sides in this armed and almost perpetual struggle were inevitable . however , nash is somewhat disingenuous when he makes the native population seemingly innocent or justified in their actions . although nash admitted that the british courted and armed the native peoples to fight the colonists , even after the revolution was over , he can not seem to find any justification for the colonists to meet force with force . lastly , as stated previously , nash bemoaned how historians and the people at large have lost the viewpoint of those below the founding fathers - how the great men still consistently dominant the narrative on the american revolution . ( nash , xv ) first , i would ask mr. nash , `` should we discount what the `great men ' did during the war ? '' while historians do deal with the `` great men '' of the american revolution , i doubt there is one serious historian out there who would discount the actions and sacrifices that were made by the people below . their deeds do not go unnoticed in narratives of the war . we read about the boston tea party , we read about the non-importation of british goods and how the participation of the common people was vital to such an enterprise . we read about the plight of the continental soldier as they nearly starve and free to death in the service of their country . what nash further discounted was the explosion over the past decades in dealing with various social aspects of the history of the revolution . bruce chadwick 's piece , the first american army : the soldiers of the american revolution , he offered the reader a look into the world of the solider in the continental army through their diaries , letters and records . through these written records , we are presented with the bleak situation that so many found themselves in - conflicting interests between home and duty , the want of food and clothing , and their battle experiences . alfred young , in the shoemaker and the tea party , offers a glimpse into the world of the common man on the streets , taking part in demonstrations and actions against the british and their oppressive measures . women 's roles in the revolution are far from ignored . mary beth norton authored a book , liberty 's daughter 's : the revolutionary experience of women : 1750 -1800 , dealing specifically with the trials and tribulations of the women during the american revolution , both from the patriot side and the loyalist side . linda kerber also wrote a piece on women in the american revolution entitled , women of the republic : intellect and ideology in revolutionary america , which also draws upon the revolutionary experience of women through their diaries , letters and legal papers . the native americans receive their fair share of print as well . alan taylor wrote divided ground : indians , settlers , and the northern borderland of the american revolution , which offers a rich , sprawling history focusing on the iroquois six nations of new york and upper canada during the era of the american revolution . taylor examines indians ' wise but unsuccessful attempts to hold onto their land as colonists encroached on it . colin calloway , in his work , the american revolution in indian country : crisis and diversity in native american communities , explored the internal strife that the revolution brought to indian nations involved with the american revolution . the african-american population in the revolutionary era also received a fair amount of print about their ordeals . glenn knoblock wrote , strong and brave fellows : new hampshire 's black soldiers and sailors of the american revolution : 1775 - 1784 , which explored the military careers of over 200 black military officers during the american revolution and attempted to reconstruct their ordeal throughout the conflict . sylvia frey , in her book , water from a rock : black resistance in a revolutionary age , explored the triangular relationship between the british , the americans , and slaves in the south . through this triangular relationship , frey attempted to illustrate the complex and confusing options presented to the slaves in the south during the rebellion . beyond the founders : new approaches to the political history of the early american republic , edited by jeffrey palsey offers readers an alternative reading in the same light that nash presents , the conflicting desires of the myriad of peoples during the american revolution . the political historians contained in this work showed that the early history of the united states was not just the product of a few `` founding fathers , '' but was also marked by widespread and passionate popular involvement ; print media more politically potent than that of later eras ; and political conflicts and influences that crossed lines of race , gender , and class . thus , this work is not beholden to one particular point of view on the revolution , as nash is guilty of being caught up in . these are just some of the books out there on the myriad of topics that nash covered and , to be sure , there are many more . these books are not hard to find . just do a search on amazon 's or barnes and noble 's online stores on any of these topics and you will be presented with a cornucopia of choices - there is not quite the neglect that nash claimed in these fields . to be sure , there will still be authors who write biographies on the `` great men '' of the american revolution , but there are many who also explore the social history of the conflict . thus , nash is not the lone voice for these `` forgotten '' as he claimed"}], "ghwb": [{"num": 1729, "context": "uss james b. stockdale , cvn-77 we all know repbulicans do n't care much for the environment , and now we 're chopping down trees to give more praise to a man whose son 's ambition is paid for with american lives . why was this book written ? are trhe bush-kochs suddenly strapped for cash ? the book , if you can focus on a father and daughter that are n't dripping with wealth and power , is good enough . i like ghwb , voted for him , but the lovefest is going way overboard . and as for the $ 500 billion dollar aircraft carrier ( the tenth and final nimitz-class supercarrier ) just commisioned and named after george , sr -- -it was absolutely wrong to do so . the man cvn-77 should have been named after is admiral james b. stockdale . admiral stockdale , a distinguished naval aviator and test pilot flight instructor , flew over 240 carrier-based missions , earned 28 combat decorations , and after being shot down over north vietnam in 1965 , spent 8 years as a p.o.w. , 4 years in leg irons , 2 years in complete darkness , tortured and beaten daily . it is amazing that he did n't go blind after 2 years in darkness , malnourished and sleeping on concrete . despite all of his pain , his primary concern was always the welfare of his fellow prisoners and that they received enough food and proper medical care . stockdale even organized a hunger strike when one prisoner was denied medical treatment . at one point , he knew that one of his fellow p.o.w.s was guilty of an infraction that would possibly lead to that prisoner 's execution . his captors knew stockdale knew who the guilty prisoner was , and tortured stockdale without mercy . knowing there would be more torture and fearful he would crack and give out the prisoner 's name , stockdale attempted suicide . rather than bear the thought of one of his fellow prisoners being executed or subjected to the pain that was inflicted on him , he tried to take his own life . stockdale 's suicide attempt was unsuccessful , yet in the attempt , was the ultimate statement about admiral james b. stockdale , that he would rather have died than see a fellow american soldier suffer pain or death at the hands of their captors . that maybe true about ghwb , but perhaps not so about our current president . adwarded the congressional medal of honor in 1976 , admiral stockdale died in july of 2005 . even ghwb would tell you that cvn-77 should have been named after admiral stockdale . why is n't that in your book , doro ? on october 7th , 3 days after your book was released , you christened the uss george h.w . bush , cvn-77 . it rained that day . so much so that the ceremony was closed to the public"}], "cowpens": [{"num": 1797, "context": "too many errors and a typical neo-confederate bias of author i bought this book on the recommendation of several people that i know pretty well , unfortunately , this book is filled with errors upon errors and is filled with a typical neo-confederate bias by the author . in fact , the book should be called `` how confederates saved america '' as he gives the credit for the peaceful return of the confederate armies to confederate generals such as lee , johnson and forrest , rather than on lincoln 's instructions to grant and sherman and generous terms known as the river queen doctrine , `` i want no one punished ; treat them liberally all around . we want those people to return to their allegieance to the united states and submit to the laws '' . his errors are numerous . he talks of the possibility of the confederates disbanding their armies and moving into the hills and waging a guerilla warfare against the us troops and sights examples of how successful this tactic has been throughout time and he includes in these examples the american revolution . he states that francis marion , thomas sumter and andrew pickens ( who all could be called partisans or guerilla fighters ) , but then he goes on to state that nathaniel greene was a guerilla fighter as well . now only someone completely ignorant of us army history could ever make such a statement . nathaniel greene served in the continental army and was the quartermaster general , he was in no way a guerilla , nor did he use guerilla tactics . he continues on that greene used guerilla tactics in battle at kings mountain and cowpens and guilford courthouse . besides the basic fact that greene was n't even at the battles of kings mountain and cowpens , neither one could be said to be guerilla attacks . at kings mountain , the american militia found patrick ferguson and his men well entrenched in defenses at the crest of the mountain and formed up and attacked the positions , hardly a guerilla tactic . cowpens was fought by daniel morgan and was a set piece battle where he destroyed tarleton 's legion . greene attacked cornwallis at guilford courthouse in another set piece battle and was winning until cornwallis took the extreme measure of firing canister directly into the center of the two massed armies , killing and wounding as many of his own men as he did americans . none of these battles were guerilla fighting and greene in no way can be called a guerilla . the author shows his neo-confederate bias most clearly by restating the apocryphal stories of rape , theft and outright murder by sherman 's troops during the savannah and carolina campaigns as matter of historical facts . he continually paints the federals in the worst of lights , while reserving his highest praise and most eloquent prose for the confederates . he incorrectly quotes sherman when he claims sherman said `` sherman himself explained that in his march , he inflicted an astonishing $ 100 million worth of damage , of which only $ 20 million was necessary , the rest being `` simply waste and destruction '' '' . he clearly is slanting his own words to convince people that sherman was in fact `` the devil '' as the neo-cons believe he is . unfortunately , what he claims sherman said has no relation to what he actually said . from the official records , vol 44 , page 13 ; in sherman 's report on his campaign to the war dept , he states `` i estimate the damage done to the state of georgia and its military resources at $ 100,000,000 ; at least , $ 20,000,000 of which has inured to our advantage , and the remainder is simple waste and destruction . '' sherman does not , as mr. winik claims state that only $ 20 million was necessary , what sherman said was that his army confiscated and used ( inured means to use ) $ 20 million worth of the property and destroyed the remaining $ 80 million of confederate civilian and private property that was going to be used against the armed forces of the united states . if you are a confederate `` lost causer '' then you will enjoy this novel , however , if you are looking for historical truth , then you should read a different book . william hal"}], "wilbourn": [{"num": 1943, "context": "overstated `` help '' book although i am not a veterinarian , i have worked in an animal hospital for two years . first of all , according to our medical practice , this book gives some bad nurishment advice ! milk ( and milk products such as cream and half & half ) are not a good food for many cats . their systems are often not equipped to digest the enzymes found in cows ' milk . having said what was foremost on my mind , i am also very disappointed in the `` behavior '' advice from this author . i found very little information on kittens ... ..and almost nothing useful ( which is why i purchased this book in the first place ! ) . in fact , i absolutely disagree with ms. wilbourn 's suggestions about introducing a new kitten into an adult cat home . from the new kitten arriving via `` escort '' to you ( as the responsible owner ) and leaving the new kitten to fend for itself all afternoon , as your adult cat `` takes care of himself and his kitten '' . what dangerous nonsense this is ! stop and think ... ..what a 10 lb . adult could do to a 2 lb . kitten , if so inclined ? perhaps the cats in manhatten are far more anthropomorphisized ( as opposed to ms. wilbourn 's coined word `` catsonality '' ) then the felines with which the rest of us are familiar ? for the record , i currently have a terrific 15 year old , as well as a very feisty 4 month old . i should have seen warning signs when this 224 page ( large print book ) began with a 19 page forward . no doubt this forward is intended to demonstrate ms. wilbourn 's considerable knowledge . sorry , it does n't . bottom line ? save your money and try another author ... .preferably someone with the letters d.v.m after his or her name"}], "matus": [{"num": 1983, "context": "do n't read this without reading matus irvin matus wrote the definitively researched text on shakespearean authorship ( shakespeare , in fact ) , and the earl of oxford fails completely as an alternative bard . i would n't go around quoting anderson 's theories in the presence of anyone familiar with matus ' evidence . you 'll get your head handed to you on a platter . guaranteed . it wo n't be a fair fight"}], "fa\ucc4cade": [{"num": 9, "context": "what russian literaute ought to be in a letter to the fourth congress of soviet writers solzhenitsyn writes , `` lierature that is not the breath of contemporary society , that dares not transmit the pains and fears of that society , that does not warn in time against threatening moral and social dangers - such literature does not deserve the name of literature ; it is only a fa\ucc4cade .

'' `` an unfinished story '' employs profound metaphors of angelic hosts to tell the tragic story of poor dulcie 's struggle for survival . secondly , his unique insight into the social conditions of his time . o. henry has a great understanding of the trials of the lower class , and he frequently pictures the lives of ordinary people of early twentieth century america with warm and sympathetic colours . his characters are frequently the overlooked : the struggling shop girl , the unsuccessful artist , the impoverished . admittedly , some of his images can be hard to comprehend for modern readers , and the distance that time has placed between us and o. henry 's beloved new york means that some of his verbal pictures will be harder to understand and identify with . but his genuine sympathy for the oppressed can not be missed . `` the gift of the magi '' is the signature o. henry story , probably his most famous tale which recounts a poor young couple who both give up a prized possession in order to purchase a gift for one another - but ironically a gift intended to complement the other 's prized possession that they have just given up . another story which display his ability to picture the social conditions of his time - but always with the trademark twist - is `` the pendulum '' , a wonderful portrait of the daily routines of an poor couple and the bursting anxiety of a married man , until the bubble bursts . `` the cop and the anthem '' was the first o. henry story i ever read , and humorously recounts the unsuccessful attempts of a man to get into jail for the winter - it remains vivid in my mind as a memorable favorite . `` the furnished room '' is a tragic and shocking story of suicide , depicting the depths of despair and desperation of the impoverished . thirdly , his warm humour . o. henry has an uncanny ability to portray the mundane and the ordinary in the most elevated language . frequently he pits two characters together in a remarkable way so that one outshines and complements the other . and on other occasions he crafts the most ingenious and humorous schemes for outwitting others . one of his most popular stories is `` the handbook of hymen '' , recounting the tale of two men in a winter cabin , one armed with the hilarious herkimer 's handbook of indispensable information . and then there is o. henry 's fictional character jeff peters , a man who comes with the most ingenious money-making schemes , two shining examples displayed in `` jeff peters as a personal magnet '' and `` the exact science of matrimony '' . `` let me feel your pulse '' pokes fun at doctors , while in `` next to reading matter '' an overly eloquent character wins the heart of a senora with streams of articulate talk about the mundane . fourthly , his ironic twist . one of the distinctive characteristics of o. henry 's short stories is the ironic twist at the end , which never fails to surprise and entertain , sometimes reversing the entire story line in a concluding one-liner . o. henry 's suspense and trademark ironic twist ensures that readers who have a good literary taste in short stories will not be disappointed . like the jeff peters stories , `` the love-philtre of ikey schoenstein '' also feature a brilliant scheme - but a scheme of romance - and the way it backfires is unforgettable . other delightful examples of ordinary stories with a glorious ironic twist include `` witches ' loaves '' and `` while the auto waits '' . the twist that comes at the end of `` the hypotheses of failure '' is so perplexing , that you 'll have to re-read the entire story after reading the ending - but completely delighted at the way in which o. henry has misled you . but perhaps one of o. henry 's best uses of the ironic twist comes in `` the last leaf '' , a warm and tragic tale describing how a dying artist proves as resilient as the last leaf on the wall outside , and through the self-less sacrifice of another . the wordsworth collection is superlative , because it contains more than 700 pages of literary gems . it consists of 100 stories , showcasing a wide range of o. henry 's short-story talents . a few popular favorites are missing , such as `` schools and schools '' , `` shearing the wolf '' , `` the green door '' , and `` the pimienta pancakes . '' but the reality is that nearly all o. henry 's stories feature his trademark ironic twist , as they do his warm humour , his unique insight into the social conditions of the time , and his brilliant use of language , and that every story in this collection is a literary delight worthy of inclusion . the inaccessibility of some references for modern readers does not prevent these stories from being always entertaining and enduring ! do n't pass up on these ! - godly gadfl"}, {"num": 423, "context": "easily the premier book on the subject of pain and suffering this great work by phil yancey was the christian book of the year in the 70 's , and has lasted the test of time . this is easily the best book on the subject of pain and suffering that i have read ; it 's teachings are on the mark and scriptural . yancey nails it when he writes that the suffering in this world is a democracy ; that we are all part of it , we all suffer , and we all can help . he makes some fine points considering all areas of the subject . he clearly balances the sovereignty of god and his will with our blessings as his children and our works . he hits on sowing and reaping , as well as the fact that just like job , sometimes bad things happen to us not as a direct result of anything we did . what i like best is yancey dives right in , going to leper colonies and interviewing with people who have suffered life-time dehabilitating injuries . it 's interesting to see how they 've coped and how they view god , and how their suffering has changed their personal relationship with god . indeed suffering is universal , yet there is no universal answer behind the causes of it or how to deal with it . i 've heard pastors preach that people have died because they smoked cigarrettes , or got a sexually transmitted disease because of permiscuous sex . but the question begs to be asked , what about those who did those things and did n't die ? is it different for a christian as opposed to a non-christian ? what man on this earth walks close enough with god to have the power to decide what sin resulted in what judgment ? if earthquakes are a judgment from god , ... are headaches a judgment from god too ? and it 's certainly an issue that none of us should be pompous about . one reviewer gave this book a one-star rating , saying that `` god gives suffering when believers desecrate his house .

tradition in terms of an agonistic oedipal struggle , arguing that the ( `` belated '' ) poet 's literary productions result from a conflict with a `` strong '' father figure with whom he must compete through a number of rhetorical phases representative of the `` repression '' of his own poetic self and the strong misreading ( or `` misprision '' , as bloom calls it ) of the work of a predecessor . bloom 's conception of the `` canon '' is a hierarchical , continuous and genealogical model of direct succession , as the young apprentice to the craft of literature subjects himself to self-imposed austerities , ridding himself of prematurely smug complacency , opening his text to the strong aura of the canon , and testing his productions against it . however , bloom 's argument is undercut by his own acknowledgement that many great writers can afford to nevertheless produce great literature by debunking the whole issue of influence , belatedness and originality , and allowing their works to flow forth from them spontaneously . this admission risks making the importance of the canon altogether trivial . another difficulty is the understanding of many writers that the ideas of & quot ; influence & quot ; and & quot ; tradition & quot ; can entirely do away with the idea of belatedness , for the poet can not be belated in a world of which he or she can still have an impact through writing and teaching . bloom 's defeatist reliance on canonical precedents , and his implicit regard that new writers have arrived too late in history to produce truly original works , reflects the postmodern & quot ; fin-de-millennium & quot ; langour that all sources of inspiration have been exhausted , and that we must abandon all hope of creating new works , but merely repeat the past . not only are his conclusions totally untenable , but his whole treatise , on its insistence on returning to canonical precedents , fails to provide for a more dynamic , more forward-moving ( as opposed to reversing , revising and troping ) theory of poetry , a theory capable of affirming life and history more fully . it would be interesting to discover what bloom would make of henry adams 's remark :

' it is a defense of his own personal christian beliefs and there is virtually no mention of other religions nor recognition of differences within christianity itself . mcgrath makes an argument that we can only be agnostic yet only applies this to atheists and clearly not to himself and other christians . he does not say what he believes about the many other gods and spirits etc humans believe or believed in though it is only possible to conclude that he must be an atheist where they are concerned . there is a valid point he makes about the correlation between religious belief and health and well-being but this does not mean that religious belief is the cause of the health . if religious belief caused good health and well-being then , as the vast majority of people who have ever lived have had one religious belief or another , we would expect the world have always been overflowing with health etc . this is obvously not the case . the only evidence offered for god is how nature makes us feel - nature being the pointer towards the beauty of god . he conveniently avoids telling us what parasites , diseases , predation , tsunamis etc etc tell us about god . mcgrath says that the question of god 's existence is not a scientific question . 'it 's more like the question of whether democracy is better than totalitarianism . ' precisely ! religions are the products of ( almost exclusively ) male minds . they are linked to self-interested tribal identity both to bond and identify 'us ' and distinguish us from 'them ' . and this is where dawkins is lost on mcgrath - dawkins ' writings undermine the very foundations for divisions and hierarchies not only of humans but of all life . dawkins ' frustration no doubt partly comes from the fact that evolved human tribalism is as ingrained as it so unfortunately is . mcgrath himself knows and says that religious belief is about identity and status . finally , mcgrath never touches on the most obvious point of religion - the promise of immortality . if this is not self-interested narcissism , a need to believe oneself so special that one can not die and will reap great rewards in heaven , then i do n't know what is . the dangers involved in this thinking are not addressed . if mcgrath truly believes we can all only be agnostic then he should be trying to persuade his fellow believers and not just atheists . if religious people worldwide adopted agnosticism it may dampen the flames of divisive , tribal religious fervor and increase general humility to everyone 's benefit . in the meantime i 'm looking forward to reading dawkins ' 'the god delusion '"}, {"num": 1529, "context": "reverse racism although i found a few nuggets in this book , i was horrified at the author 's extremist views . i will not recommend this book to the diversity committee at my school"}, {"num": 1571, "context": "good for a skim , that is all this book speculates about both the advance of computer technology in the 21st century and the socio-political response to it . although it is peppered with a few interesting notions worth skimming , much of the speculation is unreasonable and philosophically naive . in the first chapter , kurzweil attempts to lay a sort of theoretical framework for his speculations , which boils down to his belief that moore 's law is just one instance of a cosmic principle of exponential advance which explains everything from the first second of the universe after the big bang to the evolution of life on earth and now the evolution of technology . the second chapter argues that it is possible for an intelligence to create something more intelligent than itself : just as evolution `` intelligently '' created us , we will ( soon ! ) create computers which will build machines of far greater cognitive ability than us . it is indeed intriguing to consider that someday machines will outperform humans in many ways , but the book to this point is best skimmed , because there 's actually very little substance and a lot of dry , pseudo-intellectual filler . chapter 3 examines the philosophical problem that is going to be brought to the forefront by super-advanced computers : what is consciousness , and can machines possess it ? kurzweil unimpressively touches on a handful of schools of thought here ( his sentences on descartes made me wonder if he has read anything on the subject besides pop philosophy ) , though he does not try to decide between them . instead , his prediction is social : eventually machines will be accepted as real people -- just as real people will physically merge with technology -- even if that sounds bizarre to us now . this theme comes up again and again , and it proves to be one of the only thought-provoking issues of the book . chapters 4 and 5 talk about the field of artificial intelligence , where it has been , and where it needs to go . in a section entitled `` the formula for intelligence '' , kurzweil provides his recipe for the strong ai of the future : recursion , neural nets , and genetic algorithms -- all taking hints from the reverse engineering of the human brain . this wishful thinking is one of the achilles ' heels of this book . for a software entrepreneuer , kurzweil is strangely blind to the evidence : software is hardly becoming more complex or `` intelligent '' at all , let alone exponentially . today 's software systems are perhaps bigger but not significantly `` smarter '' than systems of past decades , and software quality continues to barely meet the lowest of expectations . despite moore 's law and the faith that it will continue to provide more and more cycles in the hardware world , progress in the world of software seems , to this software engineer of 15 years , to be nearly a flat line , not an exponential curve . just compare how many hundreds of man-years have gone into the lastest version of windows , versus what it would take to design and implement kurzweil 's ideal of software that is able to write more powerful software . part of the problem may be that kurzweil simply ignores the fields of cognitive psychology and epistemology , which are in their infancy . he does not seem to even be aware of the issues in these fields which would have to be solved ( probably by geniuses ) in order to create `` strong ai . '' instead , the solutions he predicts are purely materialistic : brain deciphering , massively parallel hardware , and genetic algorithms . part 2 of the book focuses on potential technologies . the most powerful computers he speculates about are quantum computers , and he does n't waste any time before asserting that someday we will be able to download the entirety of a brain into a quantum computer , so that the computer will in effect have a clone of that person 's mind . kurzweil , in his materialism , does not seem to even be aware that there is a philosophical argument that this is impossible . he also speculates about nanotechnologies and how they will eventually give us a unprecented ability to manipulate physical reality . part 3 of the book is comprised of specific predictions for 2009 , 2019 , 2029 , and 2099 . this book was written in 1999 , and we can already see that some of his 2009 predictions are either just simple extensions of things we were starting to see in 1999 , while others wildly miss the mark , such as : `` the majority of reading is done on displays '' , `` the majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition '' , and `` intelligent roads are in use , primarily for long-distance travel .

' when jesus comes back , we will know it . keys words being commanding shout and trumpet call of god . we 're not going to be zapped up while others are standing around for 7 years . in the bible , 7 years refers to completeness or totality , which is time until jesus comes back for good . lahaye and jenkins are taking figurative language from john 's revelation and making them literal and adding their own spin to sell books and make movies . this adding to scripture and polluting the word of god makes me think of galatians 1:6-9 which says : `` i am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of christ and are turning to a different gospel -- which is really no gospel at all . evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of christ . but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you , let him be eternally condemned ! as we have already said , so now i say again : if anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted , let him be eternally condemned ! '' this is what lahaye and jenkins are doing : perverting the gospel with their own spin . and your `` belief '' in the anti-christ is incorrect as well ( along with lahaye and jenkins ) . check out these verses : 1st john 2:22 `` who is the liar ? it is the man who denies that jesus is the christ . such a man is the antichrist -- he denies the father and the son . '' or 1st john 4:3 `` ... but every spirit that does not acknowledge jesus is not from god . this is the spirit of the antichrist , which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world . '' key words their being even now is already in the world . this is referring to satan who was in the world in john 's day and still in the world . the bible says in 1st john 2:18 that many anti-christs have come and anti-christ is anyone who is against christ . there are many people who are persecuting the church and christians ( as this is the last days that we are living - check out 2nd timothy 3 ) . why are we looking for somebody like nicholae when there are already those who have the spirit of the anti-christ ? why are polluting the word of god to try and sell books and movies . why are we allowing ourselves to be eternally condemned because we are starting to follow this new type of thinking ? do you think that the disciples , when jesus ascended to heaven , thought that there would be a silent rapture followed by tribulation ? no ! finally , you said that 2nd corinthians 6:2 says : `` today is the day of salvation i 'm looking so forward to that day when the lord will come for me and all born again believers that we wo n't have to endure the tortures during the tribulation . '' what bible version are you looking at . 2nd corinthians 6:2 clearly states : `` for he says , 'in the time of my favor i heard you , and in the day of salvation i helped you . ' i tell you , now is the time of god 's favor , now is the day of salvation . '' nothing about tribulation and nothing about enduring tortures ! ! ! you are just making up scripture , perverting the gospel ! now verse 4 talks about troubles ( lower-case `` t '' ) , hardships , distresses , etc . that is happening now , today until jesus comes back with a commanding shout and trumpet call of god to take us to heaven and those against him into eternal judgement - no 7 year tribulation period ! ! ! live today like it was your last day , because you could die or jesus could come back ( and believe me , you will know it because until you can show me verses where a silent , secret rapture will take place and there will be those left behind battling for seven years , i will continue to follow the god-breathed word of god and not fluff of lahaye and jenkins . `` tribulation '' is found once in the bible ( rev 7:14 niv ) and it is with a lower-case `` t '' and has nothing to do about what the books suggest . `` rapture '' never appears as this is a word that has n't been around that long . so in summary , jesus is coming back and we will know about it ( whether you are a christian or not ) . and off the subject , yes , baptism is essential to becoming a christian and being saved ( not praying jesus into your heart ) ... it seems that the same people who believe in lahaye 's rapture are usually wrong on that issue as well . please do yourself a favor . read the bible and follow it . if you do that , then you wo n't be led astray by these false teachings of someone like j. czecholinski who can not even get his scriptures straight . re : j. czecholinski wow , j czecholinski 's perverting of the scripture is uncanny . somehow , he has gotten this vision and received a new gospel along with lahaye and jenkins . most of his words are empty , his verses taken out of context , the use of visions in revelation taken literal , and his best response is this : `` this thought process has dominated rapture writings for the past 25 years . '' wow , 25 years ! forgot about centuries of beliefs that the disciples have passed down and jesus 's own words and the scriptures ( again i point to the verses you brought up 1st thessalonians 4:16-17 - loud command and trumpet call of god ! ! ! ) . and then he tries to debate the baptism issue which jesus and the disciples have passed down , but in the last 100 years new thinkers have changed that to just `` pray jesus into your heart '' , although there are many verses about baptism being essential and zero about praying jesus into your heart ( big one being said by peter , a disciple of jesus in acts 2:38 `` peter replied , `` repent and be baptized , every one of you , in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins . and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit . '' then there is : matt 3:11 , john 3 ( water and spirit ! ) , acts 2:41 , acts 8:12-16 , acts 8:36-38 , acts 9:18 , acts 19:3-5 , acts 22:16 , romans 6 , 1 corinthians 12:13 , 1 corinthians 15:29 , galatians 3:27 , ephesians 4:5 , colossians 2:12 , and the list goes on and on although the bible never says to pray him into your heart ! i think the disciple peter said it best in 1st peter 3:18-22 `` for christ died for sins once for all , the righteous for the unrighteous , to bring you to god . he was put to death in the body but made alive by the spirit , through whom also he went and preached to the spirits in prison who disobeyed long ago when god waited patiently in the days of noah while the ark was being built . in it only a few people , eight in all , were saved through water , and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also -- not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward god . it saves you by the resurrection of jesus christ , who has gone into heaven and is at god 's right hand -- with angels , authorities and powers in submission to him . '' do n't try to say that baptism is a good work and compare it to ephesians 2:8 and take it out of context . salvation requires : believe , confess , repent , baptism , and living by your faith . that is the belief that jesus and the apostles have passed down for 2000 years . so j , you can go ahead and listen to thought of the last 25 to 100 years by man , but as for me , i will listen to the scriptures and to jesus and to paul and the apostles . for paul says in galatians 1:12 `` i did not receive it from any man , nor was i taught it ; rather , i received it by revelation from jesus christ .

l'assommoir '' and `` nana , '' i was accustomed to zola 's `` naturalist '' style of reporting the details and constructing a story to make a point about second empire society . but `` germinal '' surpasses those two , mainly due to zola 's efficiency . middle-class readers in his day were likely to have invested more time than contemporary readers in reading ( no search engines or video games in the late 19th century ) , so it 's understandable why `` germinal '' is so saturated with detail . that being noted , this is a masterfully written and passionate book that makes for fast reading . zola is at his best evoking the coal elevator , the movements of an enraged crowd , the gossiping wives of miners , etc. , giving the reader a clear description of the sights , sounds and smells of the moment . a few reviewers have interpreted this is a tale of oppresive capitalism . while much of symbolism ( the mine that eats the workers , the sufferings of catherine and so on ) could give that impression , this is story of disasterous ideology . set in 1866-1867 , when the civil war in the u.s. exacerbated the coal industry 's overcapitalization in france , etienne falls in love with the proto-socialist movement ( instead of catherine ) and sets off catastrophe . the episode in which etienne , chaval and catherine wait underground for their rescuers is a potent metaphor for his relationship with the miners . there are a number of very interesting characters in this book , who evolve to the decaying situations around them and often end up doing some very shocking things . sprinkled with references to darwin , `` germinal '' features multiple characters that seems to revert to animal-like behavior . whether zola was not into economic progress as some suggest here is debatable , but there can be no mistake that he wanted to show the tremendous sacrifices that are involved . the change to the timbering rules by the company , the charge by the miners to jean-bart , and the act of sabotage by the souvarine all have their disasterous unintended consequences . and it has been unintended consequences that defeated marxism . in this way zola was prophetic . chaval is mostly portrayed as a cruel man who represents the natural urges that etienne constantly battles . a very good website by a professor at washington state mentioned that `` chaval '' resembles ``

( sorry , but sweetbreads , halves of calf heads , and brains were not appetizing subjects . ) also , i gave up finishing the book . i started to read `` an alphabet for gourmets '' , the last section , but got as far as `` d '' and could n't force myself to read through the rest of the alphabet . it seems to me by the time in her life when she wrote this section she had become rather cynical and bitter , to the extent that everything she wrote sounded condescending . this section was such a let-down , a depressant to me after coming off the high of `` the gastronomical me '' . although i exaggerate , she seemed to repeatedly state something to the effect that she preferred to dine alone on crackers and milk rather than face gourmet meals with uncultivated people ( with untrained palettes ) who were unsavvy as to the proper way food should be eaten in the first place and incapable of appreciating what they shoved in their faces in the second . anyway , other readers may disagree with me , but this last section lacks the consistency , and more important , the vibrancy and pep of her flowing , off-the-wall style that grows on you in the other sections . although i was a little disheartened at the end , her brilliance that shone through in the other sections more than outweighed the few negatives . i can recommend this book to everyone , especially to people who are interested in food as a literary subject in its own right instead of something that we simply cook and eat . of course , foodies and cooks alike should appreciate it . and though it does have some very good recipes as added bonuses , this should not be considered a cookbook ; instead , this book 's function is to serve up delicious tidbits for our minds and imaginations to savor and enjoy ."}, {"num": 335, "context": "`` a visit in the damp and dark will serve much better than the lark ... '' donna jo napoli 's trademark technique of fleshing out a fairytale is in fine display in `` the magic circle , '' her retelling of `` hansel and gretel '' . napoli 's stories often reveal motivations behind some of the action that takes place in the traditional fairytales , reasoning out some of the fantastic elements and explaining the behaviour of the familiar characters ; which usually results in the villain becoming more sympathetic and understandable . such is certainly the case in `` the magic circle '' , in which she explores the background of hansel and gretel 's wicked witch . the hunchback woman is known as the ugly one by all her neighbours , but has the gift of healing which she uses to aid pregnant women and sick people in her medieval europe community . she is the proud mother of a beautiful little girl called asa , and enjoys her simple life as midwife in her country cottage . but her friend bala has other ideas , getting her work with wealthy families and in researching demonic activity so that ugly one may earn some more money - with much of the proceeds going to bala of course . ugly one is unsure about extending her talents to exclude exorcisms , knowing the danger is extremely great , but as a devout christian and a healer she feels compelled to comply with bala 's wishes - surely god will aid her , and no harm will come to her if she places herself within a magic circle that will protect her from the demons ' tricks . after cleansing a little boy from a demon 's influence , ugly one knows that she has found her new calling in life . but once several years pass , her confidence in her own abilities grow and in a mistake that will haunt her forever , she is careless with the protective magic circle . what follows is an escalating series of events that has her transformed into a witch by the vengeful demons and tied to a stake by the terrified villagers . bartering with the demons for her daughter 's life , ugly one manages to use her newfound malevolent powers to escape and hide in the forest . in napoli 's book the term `witch ' is used in the traditional christian sense , not the new age one , so be prepared for a negative usage of the word ( personally i found it quite refreshing this way - evil witches are so rare these days ! ) however , it 's not so black and white , for though ugly one can no longer shed tears , bleed or sleep , has demons whispering in her ears and an appetite for children , she is determined to not give in to her weaknesses . living in isolation , she manages to keep the demons at bay - until she hears the voices of two lost children outside her home ... napoli 's story is poignant and thought-provoking , as she raises questions concerning the nature of evil , the will of god and the strength of the individual against temptation . like all her other books , her spin on a traditional folktale is fascinating and will change your perception of `` hansel and gretel '' forever . although her interpretation of the gingerbread house is a little weak and a revelation concerning bala is raised only to be ignored , `` the magic circle '' is an intriguing little book . the demons and magical rituals mentioned are all based in real biblical and occult study ( so you 'll learn something practical alongside the retold fairytale ! ) and its length means you can probably finish it within a day . though it is not my favourite napoli novel ( that would have to be `` zel '' and `` spinners '' ) , `` the magic circle '' is a great little read ."}, {"num": 349, "context": "the lights are going out all over europe ... `` the guns of august '' documents the events , conversations , strategies , and expectations that unfolded across europe from july to september 1914 . to brutally paraphrase the 500 pages of barbara tuchman 's genius ... .in regards to the outbreak of world war i , virtually everything that was expected did n't happen , and everything that could have gone wrong did . contrary to the `` domino effect '' jargon we 're taught in high school ( the war was a spontaneous reaction to archduke ferdinand 's assassination ) , tuchman illustrates quite convincingly ( as german primary sources have supported ... read kaiser wilhelm ii and general moltke 's speeches and memoirs ) , this war had years in the planning . in the movie `` thirteen days '' , president kennedy uses the book as a means to deride his hawkish generals and what he considers their poor sense of long-sighted policymaking . he uses the mistakes made by the generals in `` the guns of august '' as examples . but the book is not about the idiocy of generals , or even politicians . the book does not lay blame or point fingers . and when the book does pass judgment ( stubborn joffre 's plan 17 should have been aborted much sooner ) , it reciprocates in later pages ( joffre 's stubbornness helps turn the german right flank ) . the one question underlying the entire book is `` what if ?

this is in vol 5 of strabo , the loeb classical library edition in 1936 ; this is the area where the republic of armenia was created in 1918.i recently learned that its name was planned to be 'republic of erevan ' ( not armenia ) and the league of the nations promised to the government of kartu i.e . georgia that the creation of armenia in caucasia was a temporary measure-f.nansen from that league of the nations desired to create some footing somewhere in the world for refugees driven out from the balkans and that soon the league of the nations would move the republic of armenia and her armenian and other refugees-unwanted citizens of turkey-to the mediterranean.these facts are known from materials published by f. nansen available in english and some translated into russian now on the web.the creation of that republic and that of azerbaijan in 1918 in the area was the gross violation of the human rights of the indigeneous nation called by several names : the iberians , the moskhians , the kardi etc . r.heusen is absolutely right in telling readers that even before world war i , the armenians were a minority in what became the republic of armenia in 1918.after reading those truthful remarks it was a sad surprise to me to see on the next page `` a map of the historical armenia '' encompassing greater territory than the great britain.r.heusen wrote the former was 238,000 square miles against 228,000 square miles of the latter.the term armenian plateau is frequently used by the author.it is unwelcome as other names were usually used for that plateau.moses khorenatsi is discussed at several pages.it is over two centuries that he is widely denounced for being a fictitious author and therefore called pseudo-moses khorenatsi.i have thoroughly researched materials on that author in publications , in unpublished archives of prof.mikheil tamarashvili known as michele tamarati in rome and paris.many authors in xix century revealed the absurdity of the writings attributed to him : among them mr.lenormann , ilia chavchavadze criticised that pseudo author and his promoters from the mkhitarist congregation in venice- western europe for spreading false information .

nearby clyffs are reddish with minerals.this kartu/kartuli designation was given to those clyffs , the nearby village and the river by ethnic kartu population millenia ago before aliens-armenians among them-immigrated to that area-some as refugees , others as invaders accompanying alien armies.authors of this book mention a huge number of writings of persons- including the ancient persians , greeks , romans , kartu ( shota rustaveli , history of kartly , dionysius the areopagite , georgian chronicle ( p.242 ) ; myriad of modern authors and those of xix-xx cc.the book is clearly addressed to modern young ethnic armenians and teach them that they are entitled not only to what was made the republic of armenia in 1918 ( itself an abuse of the human rights of another-indigeneous nation

the journey with them . when one of the longtime main characters in the series decides to step into the warzone , he is not in the middle of some act of god that will save his life . armageddon is

his cuisine was awesome - highlighting the flavors of fresh ingredients , and many of the courses were based on raw or undercooked items . although the presentation of the food was highly stylised -

sara foster , with sarah belk king , i bought in my `buy everything i saw on the food network ' phase , especially after i saw sarah foster demonstrate her killer sticky bun recipe on the food network 's `in martha 's kitchen ' show . this was also in my sticky bun-baking period , before i gave it up as too much work and went back to straight breads . one of the main reasons the book sat unopened on my shelves for so long was the fact that the `killer sticky bun ' recipe was simply not that killer . do not believe anyone when they say they have an easy sticky bun recipe , because it probably means the end result will fall below expectations . around the same time , i did a sticky bun recipe from funny baker wayne harley brachman , and that one did n't come up to snuff anyway . leave it to julia child to come through for me . i did the sticky bun recipe in `baking with julia ' and it was a lot of work , but it in fact surpassed anything you can get from the mall . but getting back to sarah foster 's book , i have come back to it because i harbored s suspicion that there was some really good stuff in the book , and i was not disappointed . part of my attraction is that i am a sucker for any cookbook that covers sandwiches . while i think foster 's sandwich recipes are not as interesting or as complete as those in nancy silverton 's whole book devoted to the subject , they are a great resource if you happen to have no other source of ideas for sandwiches . otherwise , the book covers everything you would expect , and it is especially strong on topics where you would expect expertise such as muffins , biscuits , scones , soups , salads , and egg dishes . on one of my favorite criteria for evaluating cookbooks , the recipe for a classic french omelet , foster comes through like a champ . the only omelet tip she does not follow is to let the eggs come to room temperature before cracking and beating them , but then , this is probably quite impractical for a restaurant kitchen . she is also quite good on another of my favorite criteria , the making of stocks . her recipes are very good for non-foodies and people who care not for haute cuisine , as they do not take very long to produce a very acceptable chicken , vegetable , or beef stock . my only reservations may be that some of her suggestions may lead to waste perfectly good poached chicken on the one hand and include less than edible vegetable cuttings into stocks . there is a reason some people are hyperfussy about stock making . these are but two of the reasons . i fully endorse ms. foster 's recipes for muffins , biscuits , and scones . they are as good or better than recipes i have seen in books by professional bakers and books specializing in these subjects . the hardest aspect of whether it is worth buying this book is how if will complement your current cookbook collection . if you are a cookbook collector , the question is moot . nothing will stop you from getting this notable title . on the other hand , if all you have is `the joy of cooking ' , this would be a welcome supplement , as like fellow martha stewart alumnae , ina garten 's early cookbooks , all the recipes come from a commercial kitchen which depends on their products for good business and the products are relatively easy to make . this also means that the selection of recipes is very good fare for church bazaars and bake sales . while foster is downsizing her recipes to household serving numbers , i am sure that her soups would work well at two to four to eight times her recipe size . just be a little careful on multiplying some of the spicier ingredients . i find all the recipes extremely well written . they are full of important details for amateur chefs and unlike some books , everything is printed in good old fashioned black and white with a little highlight shading here and there for sidebars . and , several dishes are presented in living color photographs , and little real estate is taken up by cutsie pics of foster 's market staff and customers . my only argument with the layout of the book is the chapter title pages where the names of the recipes are written in a kind of multicolored hodgepodge , similar to the maddening typography in jamie oliver 's otherwise excellent cookbooks . fostering this kind of material is what made martha stewart so respectable in what she did on her shows . of this genre of cookbook , this is a very good sample . i would recommend it to anyone who is looking for recipes from this `feel good market ' venue . i think , for example , that it is more value for the money than ina garten 's first cookbook ."}, {"num": 758, "context": "splendid narrative of a horrific catastrophe this is a true mccullough masterpiece .

family experiences that are touching to say the least . the events leading up to the disaster are vividly delineated as well . the south fork fishing and hunting club was established by a small group of super-elite americans ( e.g . carnegie ) . the club was situated up the valley from johnstown , pennsylvania . the dam that held the lake fished by the elite suffered the brunt of much scrutiny in the years preceding the disaster . many argued that it 's poor design and integrity made it vulnerable to giving way in the event of heavy rains . the dam bursting was talked about for years preceding the event . many joked about it , but most thought such a calamitous event to be highly unlikely . following a late spring holiday parade in 1889 , the `` impossible '' occured . the dam gave way , and the lake entered the valley , sweeping locomotives , train tracks , woods , houses , stores along with it . entire small communities were enveloped by the heap of muck and debris on the way to johnstown . the death toll was some 2200 . mccullough paints vivid pictures of the event itself as well as the suffering in the aftermath . the corpses and muck posed and immense public health threat , with a typhoid outbreak following the disaster . the blame was quickly placed on the elite members of the south fork fishing and hunting club for neglecting upkeep on the dam that held their precious little weekend and holiday reserve . it 's a tale of early conspicuous consumption , and disturbing to find that the wealthy members of the club refused to take blame for anything . along the way , mccullough provides historical detail of the industrial revolution in its beginnings . the development steel mills , railroads , refineries , labor conditions , and business dealings of the financially elite are all intertwined in his recount of johnstown . also , details of death counts at the make shift morgues , financial support during the aftermath ( president harrison sent a personal check in the amount of $ 300.00 ) and a list of the names of the dead bring the story to life for the reader . eerie recounts of coroners ' descriptions of corpses in their logs will make your skin crawl . clara barton began organizing the american red cross in 1881 . she had worked on more minor floods in the valley prior to 1889 . her work at johnstown earned her dinner with the

'' but when one becomes one 's enemy , who won ? conservatives are nationalists . neoconservatives are internationalists . conservatives are protectionists . neoconservatives are free traders . conservatives see the culture war as essential . neoconservatives see it as a distraction . conservatives believe in defending the land militarily and project our ideals by example . neoconservatives believe in defending it offensively and projecting our ideals by force . the neoconservatives and presidential candidate george w. bush were a match on domestic policy in 2000 ( bush did n't propose a single spending cut in his campaign ) , but it appears that they hijacked his foreign policy , whatever it used to be . ( given the events of his presidency , it 's a startling reminder that this same president could n't name four world leaders when he was quizzed during the 2000 campaign . ) that foreign policy was the defense and advancement of world democracy , something that has never been america 's aim . the only proactive foreign policy we 've ever had was the truman doctrine , a stance we took when the soviet menace showed itself to be aggressive and a real threat to the united states , our allies , and our real interests . the clinton interventions , misguided as they were , were at least brief and limited , nothing that risked expansion into a long-term , regional conflict . the same can not be said of iraq . mr. buchanan gives a chapter-length history of islam and europe , setting the scene for 9/11 . the following war in afghanistan was just and necessary , and quite a diplomatic masterpiece , one that could have been the foundations for better relations with the middle east , which had shown considerable support for our efforts against al qaeda . iran , an al qaeda enemy , voluntarily offered help in afghanistan , but bush soon after named it among the `` axis of evil '' . the neocons had attached their agenda to the unclear war on terror to advance a war on iraq , a war that the neocons had pursued for years , and to be followed with a frightening series of wars throughout the region . the war on terror evolved into a quest for worldwide democracy , buffered with a moral imperative that our diseased culture violates in almost every way , and with the unrealistic belief that the middle east wants democracy , even though they 've never chosen it themselves . mr. buchanan also offers a study of terrorism , and what a touchy thing it is : the weapon of the weak , the reaction to empire , the stuff of martyrdom . with new bases in central asia , the invasion of iraq , and talk of much more war , the neocons were starting to frighten the world . china , now surrounded by u.s. bases , began building and tailoring its military for our encirclement , and leading the all-offense neocons to believe that war with them could be expected , even though their going to war with us would have been suicide . china was n't just preparing for us : it was reacting to us . the neocons were reacting to a world of their own making : filled with nations that would n't war with us if they were democratic . this is utterly divorced from conservatism , historic american foreign policy , and moral , constitutional , and realistic restraint . perhaps it 's for the best in the long term that iraq did n't turn out ; that madness seems to be coming to an end . even the neocons seem to believe that failure is now an option . mr. buchanan then turns to the domestic issues : the disaster of free trade , the continuance of big government , and the imperial judiciary . however , about all you 'll find is that neoconservatives are a problem in the sense that they 're not the solution . cultural issues have given them plenty of chances to fight and solidify their base , but they 've been silent , and often quick to fund whatever nonsense demanded funding to keep the issue from open debate and away from the hands of the democrats . neoconservatives seem to have concluded that big government gets votes , and that social issues are a distraction . but the culture war truly began with the horrid warren court , while congress did n't use its constitutional power to hold it back . the neoconservative gop seems too focused on bad foreign and economic policy to be concerned with the judicial usurpation of power it was n't meant to have . neoconservatism has n't corrected wrongs ; it has created more of them . i was hoping for some answers to an overall question i 've had about neoconservatism : where is all of this going ? how do massive debts get paid when spending is out of control and manufacturing is sent overseas ? where does peace begin after perpetual war ? mr. buchanan does n't offer anything here but the question . perhaps that 's for the neocons themselves . perhaps even they do n't know . `` where the right went wrong '' could be the prequel to `` state of emergency '' in that this book is a good summary of bush 's first term , whereas the latter defines the pressing issue of the second . however , this book includes an afterward , written in early 2005 , summarizing the voters ' response to the electric 2004 election , and defining the battle lines within the gop between traditional conservatives and neoconservatives , the fighting between which began almost as soon as the 2004 returns were in"}, {"num": 787, "context": "o'nan rights a wrong ... ... ... . stewart o'nan has corrected a major oversight by writing so comprehensively about a topic surrounded by myth and folk legend . apparently , the story of the hartford circus fire of 1944 has never been told in a book , but mr o'nan has dived into the deep end of the myths and legends and surfaced with a factual , well-researched , and eminently readable tale of the tragedy . covering all aspects of the fire and its ' aftermath , mr o'nan debunks the stories told as truth but bearing none , reveals new and unsung heroes , and lovingly examines the fate of little miss 1565 , the lovely , unclaimed child who lay so long in a grave with only a number to mark her presence . this is an exciting read , filled with the thrill of the circus , the horror of a fire out of control , the fate of survivors , and that of victims ... ... . both those who lived and those who did n't . while mr o'nan has moved on to the boston red sox in his book with stephen king , faithful , this was his first foray into non-fiction , and he has done himself proud . this is a great story , told well , and with care"}, {"num": 789, "context": "worth the read most of the reviews above are political diatribes against keynes and his central conclusion that expanded government involvement is necessary in the economy for stabilization purposes . the key to understanding keynes is the notion that at particular times in the business cycle , an economy can become over-productive ( or under-consumptive ) and thus , a vicious spiral is begun that results in massive layoffs and cuts in production as businesses attempt to equilibrate aggregate supply and demand . thus , full employment is only one of many or multiple macro equilibria . if an economy reaches an underemployment equilibrium , something is necessary to boost or stimulate demand to produce full employment . this something could be business investment but because of the logic and individualist nature of investment decisions , it is unlikely to rapidly restore full employment . keynes logically seizes upon the public budget and gov't . expenditures as the quickest way to restore full employment . borrowing the money to finance the deficit from private households and businesses is a quick , direct way to restore full employment while at the same time , redirecting or siphoning off the funds from the private sector which caused the over-production in the first place . although difficult to read , this book is essential to our understanding of modern economics . far from being destructive , it alone has been responsible for nearly 60 years of growth without a major depression as we experienced worldwide in the 1930 's . i recommend you read this book"}, {"num": 791, "context": "the mystery of the zombie hunch as the concept of the modular structure of the brain emerged , objections to the idea took the form of `` well , if my brain 's made up of computers , somebody in there has to be in charge . it had better be me ! '' this comment , paraphrased from philosopher jerry fodor , typifies what daniel dennett has been contending with for many years . although the `` cartesian theatre '' notion , that the body was one aspect of our being and the mind another - `` dualism '' - has supposedly been supplanted , it has not lost its hold on our view of consciousness . we continue to insist , in some form or other , that `` somebody , and it better be me '' is inside our minds looking out at the world . although we ca n't find that `` self '' in there , we have a hunch it 's there . when dennett wrote `` consciousness explained '' in 1991 , it seemed the `` homunculus '' representing our `` self '' had been laid to rest . this excellent collection of essays and lectures , is an update on that earlier work . as lectures , they have a conversational tone , yet impart many deep insights . addressing consciousness through four major themes , dennett shows us the project of eradicating `` dualism '' remains incomplete . until that view of `` self '' is discarded , our understanding of consciousness will remain misleading . the first theme he addresses is the `` zombie '' . philosophers have posed the idea that a duplicate person , identical to you in every way but one , is logically possible . the person would act as you act , talk as you do , have the same preferences and distastes . but it would not be conscious . this proposal presumes that something in you could be identified that is lacking in the zombie . for most of us , who still feel our `` self '' remains somehow separate within us , the logic seems reasonable . dennett carefully examines the implications of the proposal , and dismisses it as modernised dualism . if a region of the brain holds the key to `` self '' it remains out of sight and undetectable . perhaps the most challenging segment of the book deals with `` heterophenomonology '' . this tongue-twisting phrase refers to the methods used in cognitive science . because consciousness is `` often celebrated as a mystery beyond science '' dennett challenges researchers to take a step back from commonly accepted techniques . become a `` martian '' cognitive scientist to broaden the scope of the work . one facet of this approach relies on understanding what `` folk psychology '' is , then building from there . we prefer to believe that what we believe is entirely private and unaccessible . heterophenomonolgy , he contends , will expose aspects of our consciousness we view as a `` mystery '' . one of those `` mysteries '' has been wrapped in the idea of `` qualia '' . probably one of the poorest concepts in philosophy , `` qualia '' are things said to possess `` intrinsic qualities '' . when you carefully examine those `` intrinsic '' properties , they begin to fade and vanish . if `` qualia '' is in an object we see , such as colour , how can it change without our noticing ? tests of `` change blindness '' indicate we can miss much concerning `` qualia '' . even the philosophic community , dennett notes , can not agree on a definition of `` qualia '' . yet , like the homunculus in the mind viewing the world , it steadfastly remains in use . the author examines this idea further in relating the story of `` mary '' , the colour-deprived scientist . in `` consciousness explained '' , dennett proposed the multiple drafts model of consciousness and cognition . in this collection , he enhances the original concept . with no centre in the brain , consciousness necessarily must be a distributed process . the progress of imaging and other technologies have expanded our view of the brain 's functions . dennett argues that the brain is `` fame '' not `` television '' . the process is one of competition for dominance , no matter how fleeting . the mind is not a `` top-down '' or `` bottom-up '' process , but a `` sideways '' one . ideas , experiences and other informational bits jostle for `` clout '' . it 's not easy to shed the idea of a special `` self '' in your mind , but all that 's going on in there is still you . as usual , dennett has challenged successfully the `` established '' views of consciousness . clearly , he argues , consciousness is neither an arcane `` mystery '' nor beyond serious and definitive investigation . the mind-set erecting barricades using the bricks of `` qualia '' and the mortar of the `` cartesian theatre '' can , and must be , overcome for serious investigation to proceed . delicacy and care must be employed , but the prize is understanding .

'' nora roberts , writing as j.d . robb , has created a successful series based on a few basic principles . the first , and in my opinion , most important aspect is a fascinating heroine , who presents different layers that the author has been revealing in each installment and will certainly continue to do so . lieutenant eve dallas is a tough cop , who is relentless in her pursue of justice and feels as if the victims were hers to save . on the other hand , she is the wife of the billionaire roarke , and has to deal with parties and charity events in which she is expected to mingle and maintain polite chit-chat with the guests . she has been adjusting slowly to this area of her life and even though she does not like it , she has learned to accept it . the fact that eve was abused by her father when she was a child and had to kill him in order to escape also plays an important role in the development of the story and in almost every case eve faces . her husband also has a complex past , involving an abusing father who killed roarke 's mother and then lied to him about who his real mother was . only recently did the billionaire learned the truth about this and reunited with what was left of his family . besides the two main characters , robb has created a supporting cast that adds appeal to the series and which i consider to be the second factor in its success . peabody is eve 's former aide and current partner who has recently made detective and who usually adds a good part of humor to the narration with her witty comments . she is in love with mcnabb , a policeman working in the electronic detectives division , and they are in the process of moving together to a new apartment . there are other interesting characters : feeney , eve 's trainer and mentor , mavis , eve 's best friend , nadine furst , a reporter for channel 75 who has become a close friend with eve , charles , a licensed companion who is now dating a doctor , and several others . one of the most appealing aspects of the series has to do with the development of the stories of each of these people , and that is why i recommend reading the series in order . the third and final element that helps create a superb series is the cleverly crafted world in which the action takes place : new york in the year 2059 . the setting presents several characteristics that make it very different from our world , like cars that fly , drones that take care of household chores , the ban on firearms , the anticancer vaccine , the legalization of prostitution , the difficulty for getting real coffee , etc . also , the advances in terms of technology require criminals to be more clever and careful when committing their crimes , and we usually end up reading about complex mysteries . in this novel , eve is summoned to the scene of a ghastly murder . the victim was raped and strangled using a red ribbon and before leaving , the killer took out her eyes as a memento . the poor woman had a four-year-old kid and worked as hired help for a wealthy couple , and there is nothing that indicates that someone would have wanted to hurt her . everything is business as normal until celina sanchez shows up wanting to talk to eve and claiming she has information about the murder . celina is a psychic and claims that she saw the killing in a vision . even though eve does not really believe in this stuff , she goes along with it following peabody 's advice and realizing that if it does not help at least it will not hurt either . this is not the first time robb uses supernatural events in the series , but in her previous attempt she went too far making it hardly believable . in the present try the results were much better , and since the case eve is facing is one of the best mysteries in the series so far , the overall quality of the novel benefits even more . as usual , robb creates a good balance between the police procedural and the development of the personal stories of the characters in the series . of course , the romantic scenes are still present through the narration , but without overdoing it . i was very pleased with this installment , and i am looking forward to the next one . a final word of advice , the publisher 's blurb gives out important information regarding events towards the end of the novel . i would have preferred to

hard , against such overwhelming odds , to save lives quickly . i would also chastise president ronald reagan and merve silverman and give margaret heckler and bob gallo a piece of my mind -- the skunks ! i am thankful that there are politicians like orrin hatch and people behind the scenes like bill kraus and cleve jones . though he was woefully slow in responding i 'm grateful for the response of c. everett koop and that once having made his stand he never wavered and took it to the media wherever he could . randy shilts did an excellent job of showing the culture in the united states and france and the politics in the medical and scientific communities and the political posture and arena during the 1980s . he also humanized the crisis by following many of the patients from onset of medical problems to death ( enno poersch , gary walsh , frances borchelt , bill kraus , and gaetan dugas ) and by following the doctors and scientists in their fight to discover the properties of this terrible disease and conquer it . it was enlightening and helpful to have the book structured as a time line . the amount and variety of research done for this book is astounding , requiring shilts to conduct hundreds of interviews and read millions of pages of articles and medical material . in reading this book , my education has been enhanced and my life is more full and forever changed . it is a great tragedy that aids killed randy shilts as it had killed so many other innocents , and that as i write this there is still no cure for aids . as far as i can tell , it is again being largely ignored by governments and the medical community . where will the next randy shilts , bill kraus , and dr. gottlieb and the other saviors come from -- and will they come soon

'' winner of the national book critics circle award in 1985 , this thoughtful character novel focuses on macon leary , a travel writer who hates to travel , a man who has gone through life observing what is happening , but who has never been truly engaged . compulsively tidy , macon has always believed that it is possible to order one 's life so effectively that the untidiness , or chaos , that throws life into confusion can be avoided . and then his beloved 12-year-old son is cold-bloodedly murdered in the senseless robbery of a burger joint while he is away at camp for the first time . it gives away nothing of the plot to say that this event totally undoes macon and his wife , and their polite and predictable marriage goes into a tailspin . when the novel opens , macon and sarah have decided to separate , with sarah getting her own apartment ( where she can be as messy as she wants ) and macon remaining in the house with his son ethan 's undisciplined dog edward . in fact , macon has moved back with his sister and brothers in the family house , to recuperate from his physical wounds -- an accident in which he breaks his leg -- and from his emotional wounds . then into his life comes muriel , a divorcee with an over-protected , allergic , and hypersensitive son . she is a dog trainer , a flake , the only person willing to undertake the task of civilizing the aggressive , sometimes vicious `` pet '' that lives with macon . as macon tries to deal with his life , his loss of sarah ( who is dating ) , his son 's dog ( which attacks anything that moves ) , and his commitment to producing yet another travel book , his life becomes more complicated , and the depth of his relationship with sarah , relative to the shared loss they have faced , becomes an issue which must be revisited if he is ever to engage with life and explore the possibilities of a new life which muriel offers . filled with wonderful descriptions of life , both within macon 's family and in europe , where he travels for research , the novel provides the reader with a full , realistic picture of marriage between people whose relationship has been , in part , the result of their commitment to their son . poignant and emotional , but avoiding melodrama , the novel explores the meaning of life and love , the extent to which a marriage may limit or stimulate the growth of the people involved , and the ways in which a marriage must adapt to the new needs of the participants if it is to endure through time . n mary whipple"}, {"num": 859, "context": "if you 've decided to use vsto , an excellent place to start vsto ( pronounced visto ) is a most interesting product when viewed from microsoft 's overall standpoint . it is a very carefully crafted product with the primary purpose of continuing microsoft 's continued dominance of the desktop marketplace , and a part of microsoft 's thrust to move more heavily into the server marketplace . as best i can tell , it works something like this . microsoft recognizes that servers handling up web pages , processing mail , etc . are a huge market , but that linnux owns a big percentage of that market . consequently microsoft came up with the .net strategy . .net is a bunch of subroutines ( if you will ) that are written to provides all kinds of utility to programmers . you write your applications using propriatary programming languages such as c # and j # that use the .net library and consequently have to run on microsoft operating systems . in the office environment , packages such as openoffice have gotten to be pretty good , are basically microsoft compatible so you do n't have a re-training problem , and are free . i do n't know how much success openoffice has had , but it appears to be enough to attract microsoft 's attention . enter vsto . vsto adds customization and productivity to microsoft office applications through 'links ' that tie office to the .net framework . so to use vsto first you must have and load the .net framework , then you must load visual studio.net -

( these statistics are scrupulously hidden by the leftist news media . ) what have we realized from this expenditure ? first of all , state money diverted to these two deseg cases was stolen from every school district in missouri not participating in a deseg case . small , rural school districts routinely spend between $ 4,000 and $ 5,500 per pupil each year . in st. louis , the per-pupil expenditure has been as high as $ 11,711 : yet , those rural , so-called `` out-state '' districts do a far better job of educating and graduating students , despite having half the resources . ( i 'm sure in kozol 's mind they are merely `` goyim , '' and deserve no better ... ) ironically , while less affluent `` out-state '' districts were robbed of state funding by deseg , the wealthier school districts in st. louis county experienced a massive windfall from deseg : since they are reimbursed by the state the average per-pupil cost for each city transfer , ( rather than their `` marginal '' cost , ) wealthy districts such as clayton , ladue and parkway benefited from a massive infusion of new revenues , although these school districts have traditionally out-spent almost every other missouri district by a factor of three or more . ( for example , clayton currently spends about $ 15,000 per pupil per year . ) achievement in the slpss , half the students test at the 20th percentile or lower on nationally standardized tests . this stat would be even worse , except that ( i am told ) the `` ld '' ( or `` learning disabled '' ) kids do not take the standardized tests . there are legions of ld kids ... in a rare moment of wisdom and sobriety , a federal judge sitting on our deseg case ordered a test of its efficacy in the early 1990s . that study , called the `` lissitz study '' revealed that city students ( i.e. , black students ) bused to predominately white county school districts improved less academically than did every other category of student in the slps . that is , they improved less than students in all-black , the `` naturally '' -integrated , and `` magnet '' schools . when the educational testing service still `` normed '' the sats between 400 and 1600 , the average slps student had a combined sat of 760 . worse yet , these were the best and most motivated students , with further educational aspirations , who `` self-selected '' themselves to take the sats and were therefore , a highly `` skewed '' sample relative to the average slps student . deseg is almost universally motivated by the laughable paradigm that , if we throw enough money at our inner-city schools , black kids will achieve at a level commensurate with white kids . now that even william coleman has repudiated his own research on this subject , ( `` the coleman report , '' cited in `` brown v. board , '' ) kozol and deseg 's other defenders could spend their time far more productively by studying the lessons of `` the bell curve '' in order to understand academic disparities between the races . vested interests it has been remarked that the defenders of deseg will never relent until the last white kid has been driven from the system . this is because the naacp legal defense fund is a `` co-plaintiff '' in most ( if not all ) u.s. deseg cases , and is periodically distributed `` legal expenses '' by the federal courts . these are a very important source of revenue to the naacp , which has experienced declining membership and numerous financial scandals over the last several decades . similarly , deseg has meant a great deal more than the mindless expenditure of billions to bus students around . one of the most injurious elements of the st. louis deseg plan has been a massive affirmative-action program for administrators and teachers . the slpss now employ more functionally illiterate individuals than the n.b.a. , and have become nothing less than an employment agency for lazy and incompetent blacks with political connections . essentially , the same black women who , 30 or 40 years ago were employed in middle-class households as `` domestic '' help , are now slps teachers and administrators . ( `` i is a teacher . '' ) how anyone who never really absorbed a high school education could be presumed able to teach mystifies all but kozol and deseg 's other defenders . if teachers and administrators in the slpss were required to take the s.a.t.s , more than half would test significantly below average : we know this because they have already demonstrated the fact ! approximately half of all slps teachers and about 60 % of its administrators attended harris-stowe state teacher 's college , which has the second lowest academic standards of any institution of `` higher learning '' in missouri . last time i called their admissions office , i was told that harris-stowe accepted applicants with a combined sat of 780 . it should come as no surprise that recent measures of slps student sats do not differ significantly from those of many of their teachers . hypocrisy a truly fascinating phenomenon i have observed is that there seem to be few defenders of deseg among those whose kids actually participated in such a program . it does n't take a parent long to understand that deseg is n't so wonderful when your kid gets rolled for his lunch money every day , or your daughter gets beaten up because she wo n't date outside her race . now kozol may not have kids , but i 'll just bet that if he does , they did not participate in any voluntary deseg programs , if any were available where he resides . ( the jews are mustard for this sort of thing , as long as they are merely allowed to posture and it does n't actually cost them anything ... ) i once had the rare opportunity to sit next to dr. susan uchitelle , the jewish woman who headed the st. louis deseg 's `` voluntary inter-district coordinating council '' throughout the 1980s and 1990s . ( she was paid $ 60,000 per year , but from what i could discern , her sole responsibility seemed to be running interference with the news media , so the rubes out there would n't get the wrong idea about the joys and benefits of deseg whenever there was a stabbing , gun-shot incident , murder , or race riot . ) i considered it an `` opportunity '' because i was able to ask her a question that no one had ever had the impertinence to ask of her before : `` have any of your children participated in the voluntary transfer program ? '' ( that is , were her kids , who would have been `` poster children '' for the county-to-city deseg program , allowed to transfer from their all-white county schools in order to be voluntarily bused to inner-city schools ? ) what do you think was the answer , oh gentle reader ? your response to this question may have far-reaching implications for your understanding of the world around you and some varieties of its inhabitants , such as jonathan kozol ...

kurzweil unimpressively touches on a handful of schools of thought here ( his sentences on descartes made me wonder if he has read anything on the subject besides pop philosophy ) , though he does not try to decide between them . instead , his prediction is social : eventually machines will be accepted as real people -- just as real people will physically merge with technology -- even if that sounds bizarre to us now . this theme comes up again and again , and it proves to be one of the only thought-provoking issues of the book . chapters 4 and 5 talk about the field of artificial intelligence , where it has been , and where it needs to go . in a section entitled `` the formula for intelligence '' , kurzweil provides his recipe for the strong ai of the future : recursion , neural nets , and genetic algorithms -- all taking hints from the reverse engineering of the human brain . this wishful thinking is one of the achilles ' heels of this book . for a software entrepreneuer , kurzweil is strangely blind to the evidence : software is hardly becoming more complex or `` intelligent '' at all , let alone exponentially . today 's software systems are perhaps bigger but not significantly `` smarter '' than systems of past decades , and software quality continues to barely meet the lowest of expectations . despite moore 's law and the faith that it will continue to provide more and more cycles in the hardware world , progress in the world of software seems , to this software engineer of 15 years , to be nearly a flat line , not an exponential curve . just compare how many hundreds of man-years have gone into the lastest version of windows , versus what it would take to design and implement kurzweil 's ideal of software that is able to write more powerful software . part of the problem may be that kurzweil simply ignores the fields of cognitive psychology and epistemology , which are in their infancy . he does not seem to even be aware of the issues in these fields which would have to be solved ( probably by geniuses ) in order to create `` strong ai . '' instead , the solutions he predicts are purely materialistic : brain deciphering , massively parallel hardware , and genetic algorithms . part 2 of the book focuses on potential technologies . the most powerful computers he speculates about are quantum computers , and he does n't waste any time before asserting that someday we will be able to download the entirety of a brain into a quantum computer , so that the computer will in effect have a clone of that person 's mind . kurzweil , in his materialism , does not seem to even be aware that there is a philosophical argument that this is impossible . he also speculates about nanotechnologies and how they will eventually give us a unprecented ability to manipulate physical reality . part 3 of the book is comprised of specific predictions for 2009 , 2019 , 2029 , and 2099 . this book was written in 1999 , and we can already see that some of his 2009 predictions are either just simple extensions of things we were starting to see in 1999 , while others wildly miss the mark , such as : `` the majority of reading is done on displays '' , `` the majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition '' , and `` intelligent roads are in use , primarily for long-distance travel . '' that kurzweil could be so far off in his 10 year predictions does not bode well for his 20- , 30- , and 100-year predictions . indeed , his predictions for 2019 sound like a science fiction novel , and of the ones that sound plausible i think he must be off by at least 30 years . his speculations for 2029 are just fantastic . in general he seems to `` predict '' based on the assumption that new technologies will be deployed as soon as they are available , underestimating a myriad of resisting factors : legal , political , social , market , scientific , etc . ultimately this book can be fun for skimming and raises a couple of thought-provoking issues , but as speculating about technology more than 10 years in the future is necessarily a foolish activity , there 's plenty of foolishness

experiencing personal freedom in life . he says that we should be impeccable with our words , not to take anything personally , do n't make assumptions , and to always do our best . the basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from early childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents . he calls this process `` domestication '' ( p. 6 ) . ruiz says that 95 % of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection . the agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the emotional bonds that get in the way of our personal energy and to transform our lives . while there are various nuggets of truth throughout the book , some of it goes off into the abyss where he takes a thought and carries it to what i would consider to be to be an illogical conclusion . in some instances he uses biblical scripture to support his claims ; however , in looking further , he takes some of the passages from the bible out of context . some of his ideas are presented as if they were new ideas , but i would think most of us by a young age , should already an understanding of these principles . although his book has been highly rated , i hold the position that mr. ruiz lacks credibility and logic as a writer , therefore , losing good standing with me as a reader . according to ruiz , as children we are not given the opportunity to choose our own beliefs . when we go against the rules we are punished ( or rewarded for compliance ) . the fear of rejection leads us to agree with , or become something that we are not . in essence , we become a carbon copy of someone else , such as our parents . he says our normal tendencies are lost and we judge other people based upon these agreements . he boldly states , lacking statistical data to back it up , that 95 % of our beliefs are based upon a lie ( 13 ) . the implication is that we are merely nothing more than a society of mindless , `` domesticated '' individuals , hurting ourselves , judging and victimizing other people along the way . this kind of thinking negates the teachings associated with parenthood and the positive aspects they bring to our lives . by his interpretation , if 95 % of what we believe is a lie , then 95 % of what our parents taught us is also a lie . i would disagree . there are many people who exist today as viable , productive members of society who i 'm sure would point out they too became a copy of someone else 's beliefs and values . if these role models are only filling our heads with lies and teaching us how not to be ourselves , by his interpretation , we do n't need parents , teachers , or leaders . he undermines our personal paradigms and omits that as adults we do have the ability to choose a different path , which i believe is our right of passage . by his rational we lose the ability to choose our own destiny . instead , we become victims of it . one of the few things we agree upon is his first agreement , be impeccable with your word ; however , he misquotes the bible ( john 1:1 ) when he says `` in the beginning was the word and the word was with god , and the word was god . '' he uses it to epitomize the use of `` word '' as in what one speaks ( 26 ) . looking a little further down in that passage , it also says `` the word was made flesh and dwelt among us '' . this passage is not talking about a form of speech , or speaking , but rather `` jesus christ '' . christ became flesh and dwelt among us . in that same chapter he says that `` sin begins with rejection of yourself '' ( 31 ) . however , in christianity it says that sin is a transgression of the law ( 1 john 3:4 ) and that sin is neglecting to do god 's will ( james 4:7 ) . it 's not about self , but about disobeying god 's ordinances . while i agree that watching what we say is something we all need to strive for , this is not a new concept . most children have learned by the age of 6 that if you do n't have something nice to say , do n't say it at all . in his second agreement , do n't take anything personally ; he says that nothing people do is because of you . while this is true to some degree , he leads the reader down a path of illogical extremes when he says that even if someone took a gun and shot you in the head , it was nothing personal . so in essence , when mary jo buttafuoco was shot by amy fisher , her expression of displeasure regarding amy 's behavior was nothing more than a fundamental form of projection because according to ruiz `` you are dealing with yourself , not me '' ( 51 ) . no , realistically , mary jo buttafuoco was shot because amy fisher wanted her dead . this kind of logic encourages victims to remain in dysfunctional relationships and perpetrators to continue abusing victims . as an american , i 'm glad that someone took 9/11 personally . according to mr. ruiz he takes neither destructive nor constructive criticism . it seems arrogant to place myself so far above reproach , that i would turn a deaf ear to all forms of criticism . when my college writing professor , gave me his opinion regarding my work , if i were following the authors line of reasoning , i would believe that my professor was `` trying to poison my mind and was feeding me his emotional garbage '' as mr. ruiz suggests ( 49 ) . i would rather believe that my instructor has my best interests at heart and is seeking to teach me how to become a better writer . another agreement is about not making assumptions in life . he says when we make assumptions , in essence , we create unnecessary drama . unfortunately we live in a world where that is not entirely possible . assumption is a necessary part of a thought and reason ; even within the scientific community a hypothesis ( or assumption ) is formed in order to test a theory . in order come to school each day i must make assumptions that my instructor has a college degree , and that he or she must be reliable enough in life to make it to work everyday . in his forth agreement , always do your best , he claims it is based upon the actions of the other three agreements , stating they will only work if you do your best . again , these are fundamental principles that almost any child has learned . while ruiz does indeed present some viable ideas , his concepts begin to unravel when he does n't back up his statements with facts , but instead takes a basic concept and follows an illogical line of reasoning to reach his final conclusion . i ca n't completely discount everything that he says , but he lost credibility with me by some of his assumptions and weak rationalizations ."}, {"num": 1655, "context": "class warfare comes to the american revolution ? gary b. nash 's purpose for the book is , `` to capture the revolutionary involvement of all the component parts of some three million wildly varying people living east of the mississippi river . '' ( nash , xxviii ) nash bemoans how the `` great men '' still `` dominate the master narrative [ of the american revolution , ] '' ( nash , xv ) and that we are struck with `` historical amnesia , '' ( nash , xvi ) because we forgot the stories of those outside of the `` great men '' clique . he states that we can not capture the essence of the revolution without paying close attention to the experiences of the many groups that made up colonial society . these groups not only include the poor farmers , artisans , and other laborers , but also of women , blacks ( both free and slave ) , and of the amerindian population . nash illustrated the problems and plights of the lower order through their myriad of stories . to illustrate the importance of the lower classes of white society , he showed the importance of these individuals in their role as revolutionaries , which include their participation in riots against the various taxes implemented by the parliament . he also shows the tensions between the seaboard inhabitants and their piedmont antithesis to the west which , in his estimation , helped to spur change all along the way . in the case of the inhabitants of what would become vermont , he illuminated their fight against the landowners located primarily in new york city . led by ethan allen , the `` green mountain boys , '' as they would become known as , fought to keep the land that they cultivated with their own hands - against the wishes and land deeds that the new york city landowners had for their property . ( nash , 110 - 114 ) he also showed how the piedmont inhabitants of the carolinas had to struggle for their rights to live life as they saw fit as well . ( nash , 73 - 79 ) in the case of the `` green mountain boys , '' their struggle proved to be more successful than the struggle of the carolina piedmont , whose insurrection was brutally suppressed by then colonial governor of north carolina , william tryon . nash also shows how this sector of the population became mobilized politically during the course of the revolution . in nash 's estimation , these people were spurred on by the rhetoric of equality in society , as championed by the founding fathers in the countless tracts and pamphlets that were produced during the revolutionary war era . in pennsylvania , the 1776 state constitution was heralded by nash as a true revolutionary document because of its unicameral legislature , its weak executive , and its attempt to limit an amassing of wealth within the state . he also praised the fact that artisans and lower sorts also played such a vital role in the forming of the new state constitution . ( nash , 271 - 286 ) in states where the constitution did adhere to these premises , nash equated it with a betrayal of the will of the people , as evident by the problems massachusetts had in ratifying their state constitution because of its more conservative outlook . ( nash , 302 - 304 ) the talk of freedom and equality also spread , according to nash , to the black population in the american colonies . these ideals not only spread to the free black portion of the population , but also to the thousands of enslaved blacks throughout the land . this spread of ideas to the black population , particularly the enslaved portion , troubled white leaders , according to nash ( nash , 59 ) what was more troubling to the white slave owners was their perception that slave restlessness and even revolt was on the rise . ( nash , 37 - 39 ) what else was truly troubling to many slave holders was that the british actively recruited the slaves to fight against their masters - and all other rebels to the british crown . ( nash , 157 - 164 ) nash contributed much of the awareness of the enslaved to their plight the rise rising literature of freedom that the founding fathers were disseminating across the land . nash believes that this rhetoric , and its implications , were inescapable to the slaves . ( nash , 64 ) he also showed us the aftermath of the revolution for those slaves who sided with the british ; they were transported off either to nova scotia or to the caribbean islands where they were subjected to an even harsher form of slavery than on the mainland . ( nash , 426 - 427 ) women also were praised in this work , as nash pointed out how crucial this sector of the population was throughout the course of the conflict . first , women were important to execute the boycotts that were prevalent in the preceding years of the revolution . nash argued that without their co-operation in the boycotts , the measures would not have proved effective . this is because women had a great deal of involvement in the running of the household and much of the purchasing power was in their hands . if they did not adhere to the boycotts , the measure would have failed , in nash 's estimation . ( nash , 141 - 144 ) nash also illustrated how the women of the revolution became active during the war , specifically in response to rising prices for necessities . nash showed us the response of many women in the boston area to thomas boylston , a merchant whose prices on goods rose as the war progressed . in response to these rising prices , women marched on boylston 's shop , and the shops of other merchants throughout the colonies , to procure the basic necessities for their families at what they deemed equitable prices . ( nash , 232 - 235 ) the plight of the american indians was also great as land speculators and land hungry colonists swarmed over the appalachian mountain range to claim and settle upon lands that were seen as belonging to various indian nations . nash showed us how the natives resisted this encroachment upon their lands through a myriad of tactics , from essentially engaging in bushwhacking warfare with the colonists who encroached upon their lands , ( nash , 253 - 255 ) to the fact that many indian nations chose to align themselves with the british in their cause to suppress the rebellion . ( nash , 151 - 157 ) what was more alarming to nash is the colonists ' `` genocidal '' policies towards the native population . ( nash , 377 - 381 ) although it may not seem like it , there is an underlying premise to nash 's illustrations in the struggles of all of the aforementioned groups during the american revolution . that premise with nash , at first alluded to , and then by the end of the book , states bluntly is class warfare . there is , however , a very real problem in this marxist outlook on american society during the era of the revolution , specifically that the colonists did not view the class structure in the same light that we do today , or even as class was viewed in when karl marx wrote his tracts on such matters . as gordon wood pointed out in his work , the radicalism of the american revolution , `` the social distinctions and economic deprivations that we today think of as the consequence of class divisions , business exploitation , or various isms - capitalism , racism , etc . - were in the eighteenth century usually thought to be caused by the abuses of government . '' ( wood , 5 ) wood also pointed out that there were complexities and variations to american society , which fell along `` local , regional , sectional , ethnic and class differences . '' these complexities made , `` any generalization about americans as a whole , '' quite difficult . ( wood , 6 ) wood further illuminated the difficulties of following such a class distinction as nash proposed in his work . wood stated in his review on nash 's work in the `` new republic online '' : nash 's evidence for popular resistance to all this class exploitation is the incidents of rural rioting and urban mobbing that took place in the decade or so leading up to the revolution . this mobbing and rioting is exceedingly familiar to historians , who have produced a literature about it . unfortunately , these phenomena do not support nash 's argument . not only did the rural rioting have little or nothing to do with the revolution , but the urban mobs , which were indeed directed at british authority , did not represent the class upheaval that nash assumes . the rural riots all arose out of peculiar local circumstances , and were hardly expressions of some sort of coherent class warfare . ( wood , `` new republic online review ) wood , in his review of nash 's work , went on to illustrate exactly what constituted the true dividing lines in american society when he stated : but what of all the rhetoric about the laboring people contesting the aristocratic few that nash draws on to make his case for class warfare ? there was indeed a serious division in eighteenth-century american society that reverberated through the northern states over the succeeding decades , but it was not the one that nash describes . instead of being divided between a rich upper class and a poor working class , as nash sees it , anachronistically anticipating a later nineteenth-century division between employers and employees , eighteenth-century american society was in fact still divided between a leisured gentry and the mass of artisans and other laborers who worked with their hands -- many of them the businessmen of the future . in nash 's work , he viewed many of the revolutionaries as having ulterior motives for their proclamations of equality and freedom . nash , i would argue , hinted toward the idea that the founding fathers only took part in the revolutionary movement to benefit themselves . throughout the course of the book , nash takes great care to `` expose '' the double standards of the founding fathers , making them seem as if they merely wanted to continue their `` elitists '' lifestyle at the expense of the commoners below . there is no bigger whipping boy for nash than john adams , who , according to nash , was essentially a closeted monarchist who was afraid of the people . to be sure , adams did have his reservations about the people , but it was more a fear of a `` tyranny of the masses '' than it was an outright fear that the people would displace the leaders of the new nation . however , what is truly ironic is that nash relied so heavily upon the writings of john adams to illustrate many of his points . not only did he rely on adams ' writings , but also the writings of many of the other founding fathers . throughout the course of the book , when nash referred to any of the writings of the founding fathers , i found myself wondering if nash was cropping their words to support his case . it is my belief that this is something that seriously needs to be explored in greater depth than i can provide here . what is also ironic is that nash makes little use of the narratives of those whose stories he claimed he wanted to tell . outside of the use of joseph plumb martin 's narrative of his experiences as a soldier in the continental army during the war and the autobiography of ethan allen , he does not make extensive use of the diaries and letters of many people who lived through the war experience , both in the military and in the civilian sector . to be sure , there are many diaries out there from those below who can illuminate their thoughts throughout the era . would their writings bear out what nash proposed ? nash criticized the continental congress for not being able to pay the soldiers their salaries . this inability to pay the soldiers wages stemmed from the fact that the government was essentially broke : they were unable to levy taxes on the people of the colonies because of the weak governmental structure from which they operated and many of the colonies did not pay their fair share of the financial burden of the revolution . when robert morris tried to restore fiscal responsibility to the war effort and raise revenue to provide pay and necessities to the army , nash viewed it as an attempt to `` tame the social and political radicalism of the revolution . '' ( nash , 367 ) however , i suppose nash chose to forget the fact that morris was trying to get revenue to provide for the war effort . why then would thomas paine , one who nash seemed to have great respect for his principles of democracy , agreed to author a pamphlet on behalf of robert morris in favor of his new fiscal plan . ( nash , 395 ) if morris ' plan was so stifling to democracy , intended to roll back the radicalism of the revolution , then why would paine agree to be a party to it ? not all of these explanations and questions would mesh well with nash 's outlook on morris and the founding fathers at large . further , if the founding fathers truly wanted rule for themselves , there was no better chance for one of them to establish it than with the `` newburgh conspiracy . '' it is true that the soldiers and officers of george washington 's army were deeply distraught by the ineffectual abilities of the congress to pay wages and provide for basic necessities . ( nash , 370 - 371 ) however , what nash failed to mention is the other half of the conspiracy . the men wanted to march on the continental congress and put george washington in power . washington , through an impassioned speech and performance , quelled all of these thoughts and possibly saved the revolution once again . nash , as stated previously , believed the struggle of the thousands of black slaves in the colonies was heightened by the revolutionary rhetoric that littered the landscape of the era . he believed that such literature raised their awareness and caused more unrest and rebellion than at any time previously . however , i would like to offer my own take on this . did it take pamphlets from the founding fathers to raise the awareness of the enslaved that there was something unnatural about their situation ? i certainly think not . frederick douglass ' autobiography indicates that from a very early age , he was well aware that there was something wrong with the situation he found himself . in an illustration , a still teenage douglass talked with some of his young white friends on the streets of baltimore and they complained about their lot in life . douglass illustrated the point when he wrote , `` you will be free as soon as you are twenty-one , but i am a slave for life ! '' ( douglass , 53 ) while douglass certainly is an exceptional individual , i doubt that this same premise was lost on the countless enslaved individuals in the colonies and that they wanted freedom and it did not take pamphlets for that realization to come to mind . nash lamented the `` genocidal policies '' towards the amerindians adopted by many colonists during the revolution . while it is true that atrocities were committed against the natives , first , this was nothing new by this point in american history . warfare between the natives and colonists was an almost constant from the time that european settlers stepped onto the new world . in such a climate , atrocities committed by both sides in this armed and almost perpetual struggle were inevitable . however , nash is somewhat disingenuous when he makes the native population seemingly innocent or justified in their actions . although nash admitted that the british courted and armed the native peoples to fight the colonists , even after the revolution was over , he can not seem to find any justification for the colonists to meet force with force . lastly , as stated previously , nash bemoaned how historians and the people at large have lost the viewpoint of those below the founding fathers - how the great men still consistently dominant the narrative on the american revolution . ( nash , xv ) first , i would ask mr. nash , `` should we discount what the `great men ' did during the war ? '' while historians do deal with the `` great men '' of the american revolution , i doubt there is one serious historian out there who would discount the actions and sacrifices that were made by the people below . their deeds do not go unnoticed in narratives of the war . we read about the boston tea party , we read about the non-importation of british goods and how the participation of the common people was vital to such an enterprise . we read about the plight of the continental soldier as they nearly starve and free to death in the service of their country . what nash further discounted was the explosion over the past decades in dealing with various social aspects of the history of the revolution . bruce chadwick 's piece , the first american army : the soldiers of the american revolution , he offered the reader a look into the world of the solider in the continental army through their diaries , letters and records . through these written records , we are presented with the bleak situation that so many found themselves in - conflicting interests between home and duty , the want of food and clothing , and their battle experiences . alfred young , in the shoemaker and the tea party , offers a glimpse into the world of the common man on the streets , taking part in demonstrations and actions against the british and their oppressive measures . women 's roles in the revolution are far from ignored . mary beth norton authored a book , liberty 's daughter 's : the revolutionary experience of women : 1750 -1800 , dealing specifically with the trials and tribulations of the women during the american revolution , both from the patriot side and the loyalist side . linda kerber also wrote a piece on women in the american revolution entitled , women of the republic : intellect and ideology in revolutionary america , which also draws upon the revolutionary experience of women through their diaries , letters and legal papers . the native americans receive their fair share of print as well . alan taylor wrote divided ground : indians , settlers , and the northern borderland of the american revolution , which offers a rich , sprawling history focusing on the iroquois six nations of new york and upper canada during the era of the american revolution . taylor examines indians ' wise but unsuccessful attempts to hold onto their land as colonists encroached on it . colin calloway , in his work , the american revolution in indian country : crisis and diversity in native american communities , explored the internal strife that the revolution brought to indian nations involved with the american revolution . the african-american population in the revolutionary era also received a fair amount of print about their ordeals . glenn knoblock wrote , strong and brave fellows : new hampshire 's black soldiers and sailors of the american revolution : 1775 - 1784 , which explored the military careers of over 200 black military officers during the american revolution and attempted to reconstruct their ordeal throughout the conflict . sylvia frey , in her book , water from a rock : black resistance in a revolutionary age , explored the triangular relationship between the british , the americans , and slaves in the south . through this triangular relationship , frey attempted to illustrate the complex and confusing options presented to the slaves in the south during the rebellion . beyond the founders : new approaches to the political history of the early american republic , edited by jeffrey palsey offers readers an alternative reading in the same light that nash presents , the conflicting desires of the myriad of peoples during the american revolution . the political historians contained in this work showed that the early history of the united states was not just the product of a few `` founding fathers , '' but was also marked by widespread and passionate popular involvement ; print media more politically potent than that of later eras ; and political conflicts and influences that crossed lines of race , gender , and class . thus , this work is not beholden to one particular point of view on the revolution , as nash is guilty of being caught up in . these are just some of the books out there on the myriad of topics that nash covered and , to be sure , there are many more . these books are not hard to find . just do a search on amazon 's or barnes and noble 's online stores on any of these topics and you will be presented with a cornucopia of choices - there is not quite the neglect that nash claimed in these fields . to be sure , there will still be authors who write biographies on the `` great men '' of the american revolution , but there are many who also explore the social history of the conflict . thus , nash is not the lone voice for these `` forgotten '' as he claimed"}, {"num": 1681, "context": "not badly written , but ultimately preposterous toward the end of this

' how he oher half lives how the other half lives was written over a century ago as an expose ' of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of new york city . the author speaks with a crusader 's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements , these streets , and these people as if they were living today . this is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men , the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of new york city in the late 1800s . he so graphically describes the filth , the sunless and airless rooms , the crowding , and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart . riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people 's plight . his pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery . he , for the most part , blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions : `` how shall the love of god be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man . '' ( p. 266 ) . he laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor . then , after his extensive discourse , he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions , something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers . riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says , `` if this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice , it has served its purpose . '' the author apparently succeeded with his purpose , because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us : `` this book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major u. s . cities . '' how does this book relate to adult education ? by moving chronologically from the founding of america to the slums of nyc in the 1800s , are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years ? certainly riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem . `` thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education , all the more urgent because these people are poor , miserably poor almost to a man . '' ( p. 147 ) . he does not forget that this `` education '' is not only for the poor people , but also for the wealthy landlords . `` clearly , it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant . '' ( p. 270 ) . riis ' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity . `` it is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society . '' ( p. 233 ) . the relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society . although this book was exhaustive in its detail , it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening . i found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that riis used for the different races . in a sense it reads like a ginsberg poem ; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era . read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm : jewtown , bandit 's roost , double alley , the bowery , the bloody sixth ward , the fourth , fifth and tenth wards , blindman 's alley , the bend , the battery , little italy , the french quarter , hell 's kitchen , the west side , bottle alley , frog hollow , poverty gap , murderer 's alley , gotham court , the old brewery , old africa , potter 's field , blackwell 's island asylum , rogues ' gallery , penitentiary row , chinatown . the list goes on . to someone reared in rural america , this chant sounds like a song about another country . riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of new york city : chinaman ( he ca n't be taught ) , ( chinese ( coolie -- laundry business ) , polish jew ( coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling ) , russian jew , jew ( money is their god ) , bohemian ( poor , but thrifty ) , blacks ( like to gamble , but they are clean ) , greek , hebrews ( tailors , all of them ) , dutchman , irish ( like to drink and have expensive funerals ) , german ( order loving ) , swiss , pasquales , russian , italian ( a born gambler ; lighthearted and gay ) , swamp angel ( thieves ) , street arabs ( army of homeless boys ) , tramps and toughs ( the world owes them a living ) , and the celtics . i was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and riis ' comments about every race . i noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day . riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday . i hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days . does every generation think that is happening in their time ? not only should this book be used by people researching new york city`s tenements , but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change . it is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man 's greed overrides his concern for human dignity ."}, {"num": 1806, "context": "this did n't make me happy - its hard to be emphathetic towards a protagonist who 's depressed and decides to have an affair when she already has a great husband , two healthy children and no financial worries . two stars because the addition of the `` history of happiness '' ( research for a book she is writing ) was interesting ."}, {"num": 1809, "context": "not worth saving people have called chuck palahniuk 's writing many things : neo goth , modern goth. , new goth ... .just dont get the idea that its all about whiny teenagers wearing black and griping about their latent vampire powers through bad poetry . no , palahniuk writes a different kind of book without all of the grim color and stale mythology , but he maintains the same themes : deterioration of the human condition , lack of moral fiber in today 's society , and the danker recesses of the human psyche . survivor tackles these topics with dazzling success and even enters a few new contenders to the mix such as commercialism , consumerism , and materialism . and this is all very old news to absolutely everybody but me , because chuck palahniuk has been around for a while now . it was only until recently i decided to pick up one of his paperbacks at the suggestion of my thugish top 8 myspace friend with too much facial hair and the clown tattoo . now , the way i like my stories told is with a good opening page , a large use of style , and a frugal use on the words . typically , i do n't read too many novels over 300 pages long . i have read plenty of longer books in the past , and all too often the only thing that separates a long story from a short one is that the author of a short book knows how to consolidate his word use and when to shut up . i 'm happy to say chuck palahniuk is such a writer by all counts . like any good stylist , his words flow like water straight from the page into your brain as the protagonist 's situation is fleshed out . survivor opens in the first person with a single man on a plane preparing to crash into the australian outback . he 's the last surviving member of a death cult who has made some strange decisions ... some better than others . at this time he is known the world over as a great spiritual leader , anti christ figure , and media mogul . there are many misconceptions about who he is and why he 's on said death plane , and he 'd like to set the record straight with the help of the jets black box . and from there we meet the narrator , tender branson , now in the past tense and living in humble times as a religious servant . members from his cult are killing themselves left and right , so the government gives branson his own psychotherapist and puts him on suicide watch . but branson is way past believing anything the church filled his mind with , and is more interested in telling other people to kill themselves after they find one of his phony suicide hotline numbers stuck to the side of a bus stop . he works for a couple that is very well off , and through his years of service has accumulated a library 's worth of useful housekeeping tips . the reader is educated , in detail , how to properly remove tear stains from pillow cases , urine from drapes , bullet holes in walls , and blood from fur coats . everyday situations are presented from the most warped of perspectives , and depending on the readers attitude , this may either be disturbing or refreshing . example : is learning that everyone you love will someday die from owning and loving upwards of six hundred pet goldfishes that have all died strike you as ironic , or sad ? are you intrigued by romances sparked in a cemetery , or turned off ? how about an over analytic shrink who convinces a hypochondriac that he has multiple problems in an attempt identify and cure just one ? clever , or whatever ? if you 're leaning towards the former with any of these , i might have an author to recommend . the characters are wonderful , and i took to them like a kid to a black van with candy . they have no need for convention . they have their own means of courtship , their own philosophies forged in solitude and cynicism , their own reasons for being attracted to someone else , and their own reasons for living and dying . but none of this is to say that everything is mentos and diet coke . while i 've never read another palahniuk book , i have seen fight club , a filmed adaptation if his book , and the voice of the protagonist in that story is very similar to the voice in this one . i could n't even read a sentence here without hearing edward norton 's voice , so similar were the personalities . both had a very sardonic tone towards everything modern and cynical one liners about the status quo . sloppy , but ill let it pass . did i mention that everything i just said only applies to the first half of the book ? the second half falls to pieces and leaves what could have been over arching themes or meanings in smouldering shambles . it 's a shame really . the first one hundred and fifty pages of survivor read very much like something i might very well write ten years from now , whereas the second half was more like the rough draft of something i could write now . character actions break the bank of plausibility and some scenes read like the author is trying to beat you over the head with some point that you just ca n't make out . for a book that started out so strong , i was left with a story that ultimately delivered nothing but the comical and poignant one liners it offered along the way . but hey , that 's life , is n't it ? well sure , its life , and its shaggy dog story telling too , but read both halves and tell me that something wasnt wasted from the first one . threads were coming together . if the book had stayed on course all the way through , i 'd be using this review to announce chuck palahniuk as my new favorite author , and maybe survivor as a favorite book . unfortunately , the second half was so lacking , i can barely recommend it as a whole . but there 's no reason that good writing should go to waste . use the first two chapters here to qualify yourself for all of palahniuk 's writings . you can do it in one sitting and be introduced to a wonderful mind and voice . from there you can hopscotch the palahniuk library with some assurance that everything will be a-ok in your tragedy of choice ."}, {"num": 1810, "context": "smart dogs , dumb authors i could n't even begin to count all the things stanley coren gets wrong in the intelligence of dogs . for instance , in one section he claims that dogs have the ability to do math but in another part of the book he claims they ca n't tell the difference between a tug toy and human skin . the first is clearly way beyond a dog 's capacity , while the second is something which comes totally natural to them . how did coren get things so backwards ? and the `` intelligence '' tests he provides have nothing to do with intelligence but in how focused or driven a dog is to do the test ( or game ) while you 're doing it . for instance , i tried one of the tests with my dog by putting a piece of food under a towel , then waited to see how long it took him to find the treat . i 'd still be waiting if i had n't decided he 'd never look under that towel . then i tried the same game by teasing my dog with one of his favorite toys . then i hid it under the towel , and it took him less than a second to get that toy . so my dog is apparently both on the smarter and dumber ends of coren 's intelligence spectrum . ( this is just one example , by the way : the whole idea of testing a dog 's iq like this is bogus . ) and do n't get me started on coren 's pedantic retelling of the alpha myth . granted , he wrote this book before the latest research on wild wolf packs proved that there 's no such thing as a dominance hierarchy , or an alpha wolf , or the rest of that alpha nonsense . though , i doubt if even that data would change coren 's mind . after all , he seriously recommends rolling your dog over on its back every day and pulling one of the animal 's hind legs in the air to create a posture which supposedly `` signifies submission to the pack leader . '' ( really ? dogs use `` signifiers '' now ? ) the funny thing is , shortly after reading that passage i saw a wolf documentary on tv and the papa wolf did the exact opposite or what coren recommends ! he rolled over on his back and let the pups jump on top of him and bite his nose ! they loved it ! so i tried what the papa wolf did with his pups with my dog -- an alpha male , if there ever was one -- and he loved it . and later that night , on our last walk , he was ten times as obedient to me than he had been before i 'd mimicked the papa wolf 's behavior . again , coren had everything exactly backwards to reality . this `` through the looking glass '' quality persists throughout the book , with coren even saying that dogs are capable of hypothetical , symbolic , and conceptual thinking . wha.. ? i 'm sorry . i love dogs and i think they have wonderful abilities that should be honored and respected , but the abilities they do have are geared for being a dog , not a mini-me with four legs and a tail . for one thing , fully one third of a dog 's brain is devoted to processing olfactory information , and none to processing symbols and concepts . i think coren needs to do a little more research on comparative neuroanatomy and actual wolf behavior before he makes more ridiculous claims like the ones he made in this inane book ."}, {"num": 1814, "context": "paranoid and unhelpful should you be afraid of your microwave oven ? this book discusses that non-issue for several paragraphs , before concluding that no , you probably should n't be afraid of your microwave . that embodies what 's wrong with this book . it pretends to be reassuring while actually planting a bunch of paranoid ideas . it also assumes that you , the reader , are the mother-to-be , while having very little to say to your partner , in a way that i find subtly sexist . overall , it has plenty to make you extra-worried . for instance , it advises posting pictures of healthy babies all around your house ( on the door , in the kitchen , on the bathroom mirror , really , all around your house ) , in order to continually remind yourself to eat a very rigid diet -- as if the bump in your belly was n't already making you worry quite enough . if you think that it would be helpful to post a nagging sign on your front-door to ask you daily , `` have you fed your baby breakfast today ?

although containing 458 pages of main text , hourani 's history devotes a mere seven pages to the pre-islamic period . this is pretty amazing , for anyone familiar with that period , since arab history prior to islam is roughly as long as arab history after it . exactly how far back arab peoples go in history is a matter of dispute , but certainly there were people one could call `` arabians '' as far back as the beginning of the first mellinnium bc , or 1,600 years prior to muhammad . the evidence is sporadic for sure , and no writer would give it equal prominence with later times , but seven pages is pretty paltry . one might suspect an islamic bias here , but the problem continues in the key early periods of islam . the life of muhammad and his immediate successors who established the basis for the muslim world , spanning about a half century from muhammad 's first vision to the death of his son-in-law and successor ali , get only 11 pages . the first arab empire , the umayyads ( 661-950 ) , gets seven pages , and the abbasid empire ( 750-circa . 945 ) , which is usually thought of as the `` golden age of islam , '' gets only six . this means 37 pages for the first 2,000 years of arab history , including its framing epoch , and over 400 pages for the next 1,000 . this would leave the uninitiated reader entirely without much sense of proportion . what makes this book highly unrecommended for the beginner is its weak sense of organization . the middle time period between the collapse of abbasid authority - roughly ad 950 - and the ascendance of the ottoman empire over the arab world in 1517 is intrinsically a difficult time period to understand and a more difficult one on which to write a history . this is due to the fact that rather than there being one dominant power or a few powerful states , there is instead a multiplicity of dynasties with genuine authority in some areas not extending beyond the town level with a multifarious mixture of sunni and shia , arab , persian and turkic ruling groups , not to mention the latin states . hourani makes no serious attempt to help the reader keep all of it straight by moving from a chronological approach prior to 950 to a topical one . there are ten chapters covering this time period and the social history of part of the previous two periods ( the umayyads and the abbasids ) . there is one chapter which discusses the major power struggles of the time . if you want to understand the relative historical roles of the buyids , the fatimids , the zengids , the ayyubids , the mamluks and their contemporaries , read something else . it is within these ten chapters that this book contains its major strength - its `` social history , '' or its description of the development of the arab world . in fact i cited hourani on the social history sections of my own book . in this regard , hourani really is better than the alternatives . over 200 pages of the book is devoted to detailing various aspects of how the arab world came to be prior to the ottomans . so for those who have already read a general history of the middle east or the arab world and want a more specialized knowledge , these chapters are quite useful . i have several objections to how this book handles a variety of issues of current interest . this book was written during a time period when there was a great emphasis on negating certain negative images of arabs and muslims , to the point of deemphasizing any aspect of the arab world which might be interpreted negatively . the word `` jihad '' does n't even have an entry in the index , although it is used , or perhaps , misused . on page 247 , hourani describes a traditional view stipulating that the ruler has an obligation `` to pursue jihad by maintaining the strength of the kingdom 's defense ... '' this gives a misimpression , because legally jihad has two military meanings - the defense of muslim lands and the muslim community 's collective obligation to spread islam through conquest . although jihad has a spiritual as well as martial application , its use is overwhelmingly in the military context , and while muhammad 's battles probably could be described as defensive , the vast majority of military actions between that time and the 19th century involved offensive operations ( the christian counter-offensives known as the crusades being a major exception ) . more broadly , the single most influential islamist movement of the modern age , the wahhabis , get only a few scattered mentions , and there is no real indication of the wave of extremism which by 1991 had been felt for some time . the primary non-islamist ideological influence , marxism , is discussed of course , but the influence of nazism during the 1930s and 1940s is left out . nazi germany is mentioned once in passing , and in the same paragraph on page 331 palestinian leader amin husseini is mentioned , but it is n't mentioned that he was a strong supporter of nazis , that he moved to germany during the second world war and played an active role in the holocaust , or that despite this he was made leader of the palestinian cause by the nascent arab league after the war . hourani 's account of the 1967 is incredibly inaccurate , giving the impression that egypt engaged in some bluster and then israel started the war . he mentions nasser 's demand that the un clear out of the suez canal zone , and includes the defense pact with jordan , but omits a key fact - the mobilization of egyptian forces in the sinai . once egypt did this , israel had no choice but to attack , because of its small population its economy could not handle an extended mobilization , while egypt could . hourani also does n't mention the statements by arab leaders to the effect that all jews would be wiped out in the coming war . on the whole , this is a useful book if one already has a framework understanding of arab history and if one understands the slant that is being presented on issues of contemporary concern . otherwise , i do not recommend buying it"}, {"num": 1873, "context": "dangerous misinformation suzanne somers apparently has no use for modern medical science . especially as a survivor of breast cancer ( although of a very early stage ) she is putting her life in grave danger by taking hormones . recent studies have shown that women who were taking hrt for protection from heart problems actually had more problems than normal menopausal women . this is an unbelievably destructive , horribly dangerous book for people to take seriously . being skinny is not more important than being alive . if you want to get the real scoop on hormones , talk to a doctor at an academic medical center ( in other words , one that is n't going to mislead the public for personal financial gain ) and see what she or he has to say . chances are excellent that you 'll be told to avoid them at all cost . look at it this way : are you going to put your very life in the hands of suzanne somers ? i 'm sure she 's a very nice person ; it 's just that she has no medical training whatsoever . *** writing from an nci-designated comprehensive cancer center**"}, {"num": 1883, "context": "morally repugnant for 54 years there was no seperation fence or 'apartheid wall ' built by israel to stop the human assaults of suicide bombers . but this is the cover of this book and points to what is really going on here . the argument is simple , had zionism not existed there would be no arab-israeli conflict . had israel created a palestinian state , that he jordanians refused to from 1948-1967 , there would have been peace . the entire onus for any conflict in the middle east rests with israel . this is an interesting argument . israel is unique in being one of the few states created by an ideology , rather than an ideology rising out of a nation ( rather zionism rose out of the jewish nation , but not in its present borders ) . however it is not the only example . the risorgimento in italy is responsible for odern italy and in a number of other pleace latent ideologies have done the same , creating nations out of loose federations . after all modern moldova has little historical merit and neither does kosovo . for that matter most of the borders of the arab states also arise out of modern ideology , especially the borders of modern turkey . only apparently in israel is this a problem . the reason is remarkably simple , only in israel did the creation of the new state result in 50 yeas of warfare . other 'old ' conflicts like that over kashmir are likely a result of the same . but we do not readily argue that the existence of india is responsible for the kashmir conflict . it would be hard to imagine the title of an book about another nation being 'the case against ..

'' he uses it to epitomize the use of `` word '' as in what one speaks ( 26 ) . looking a little further down in that passage , it also says `` the word was made flesh and dwelt among us '' . this passage is not talking about a form of speech , or speaking , but rather `` jesus christ '' . christ became flesh and dwelt among us . in that same chapter he says that `` sin begins with rejection of yourself '' ( 31 ) . however , in christianity it says that sin is a transgression of the law ( 1 john 3:4 ) and that sin is neglecting to do god 's will ( james 4:7 ) . it 's not about self , but about disobeying god 's ordinances . while i agree that watching what we say is something we all need to strive for , this is not a new concept . most children have learned by the age of 6 that if you do n't have something nice to say , do n't say it at all . in his second agreement , do n't take anything personally ; he says that nothing people do is because of you . while this is true to some degree , he leads the reader down a path of illogical extremes when he says that even if someone took a gun and shot you in the head , it was nothing personal . so in essence , when mary jo buttafuoco was shot by amy fisher , her expression of displeasure regarding amy 's behavior was nothing more than a fundamental form of projection because according to ruiz `` you are dealing with yourself , not me '' ( 51 ) . no , realistically , mary jo buttafuoco was shot because amy fisher wanted her dead . this kind of logic encourages victims to remain in dysfunctional relationships and perpetrators to continue abusing victims . as an american , i 'm glad that someone took 9/11 personally . according to mr. ruiz he takes neither destructive nor constructive criticism . it seems arrogant to place myself so far above reproach , that i would turn a deaf ear to all forms of criticism . when my college writing professor , gave me his opinion regarding my work , if i were following the authors line of reasoning , i would believe that my professor was `` trying to poison my mind and was feeding me his emotional garbage '' as mr. ruiz suggests ( 49 ) . i would rather believe that my instructor has my best interests at heart and is seeking to teach me how to become a better writer . another agreement is about not making assumptions in life . he says when we make assumptions , in essence , we create unnecessary drama . unfortunately we live in a world where that is not entirely possible . assumption is a necessary part of a thought and reason ; even within the scientific community a hypothesis ( or assumption ) is formed in order to test a theory . in order come to school each day i must make assumptions that my instructor has a college degree , and that he or she must be reliable enough in life to make it to work everyday . in his forth agreement , always do your best , he claims it is based upon the actions of the other three agreements , stating they will only work if you do your best . again , these are fundamental principles that almost any child has learned . while ruiz does indeed present some viable ideas , his concepts begin to unravel when he does n't back up his statements with facts , but instead takes a basic concept and follows an illogical line of reasoning to reach his final conclusion . i ca n't completely discount everything that he says , but he lost credibility with me by some of his assumptions and weak rationalizations ."}, {"num": 1658, "context": "what a piece of garbage this comic is so stupid . when you boil it down , it 's nothing but `` white people do this , and black people do this '' jokes with `` bush is stupid !

'' ( p. 266 ) . he laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor . then , after his extensive discourse , he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions , something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers . riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says , `` if this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice , it has served its purpose .

'' how does this book relate to adult education ? by moving chronologically from the founding of america to the slums of nyc in the 1800s , are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years ? certainly riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem . `` thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education , all the more urgent because these people are poor , miserably poor almost to a man . '' ( p. 147 ) . he does not forget that this `` education '' is not only for the poor people , but also for the wealthy landlords . `` clearly , it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant . '' ( p. 270 ) . riis ' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity . `` it is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society .

from herr doktor gershom scholem ( 1897-1982 ) through his text , & quot ; on the kabbalah and its symbolism & quot ; . dr bernard mcginn , divinity school , university of chicago , wrote in the introduction , & quot ; i believe that all students of mysticism should read scholem , not only for his profound insights into the jewish mystical tradition , but also to deepen their understanding of the dynamics of other mysticisms -- christian , islamic , and even those further afield. & quot ; professor scholem presents an historical perspective with the full knowledge that there are other approaches . & quot ; from an historical point of view & quot ; , he writes , & quot ; the sum of religious phenomena known as mysticism consists in the attempts of mystics to communicate their experiences to others. & quot ; within this context , this text explores broad sweeping topics in each chapter -- topics that deservedly have receieved attention by intelligent scholars for centuries . in the first chapter , & quot ; religious authority and mysticism & quot ; herr doktor scholem presents a thesis fundamental to his research , & quot ; there is no mysticism as such , but only the mysticism of particular religious systems , christian , islamic and jewish mysticism , and so on & quot ; . the mystic working within a religious system is , according to scholem , at the same time both conservative and revolutionary . & quot ; conservative & quot ; because the mystic tries to preserve the sources of traditional authority , and & quot ; revolutionary & quot ; because the mystic also may subsititue his own opinion for that prescribed by authority . in the second chapter , titled , & quot ; the meaning of the torah in jewish mysticism & quot ; , scholem explains the dynamic relationship between the torah and the mystic . scholem presents three fundamental principles on which the kabbaslistic conceptions of the nature of the torah are based : ( 1 ) ywvh ; ( 2 ) torah as oganism ; ( 3 ) infinite meaning of the divine word . as an example of the third , in addition to the the concept of written and oral torahs , the author of the & quot ; zohar & quot ; speculates four levels of meaning : ( 1 ) literal ( 2 ) hermeneutic ( 3 ) allegorical and ( 4 ) mystical . the history of judaism , scholem explains in the third chapter , is a tension between the purity of the reality of god . the dynamic involved is clearly presented in the realization that the price of god 's purity is the loss of her living reality . scholem offers that the book bahir , a cornerstone of 12th century kabbalistic thought , introduces myth into judaism . remarkably , it contends evil as an attribute of god . in a similar vein , the commentary on the sefer yetzirah by judah ben barzilai introduced speculative thinking to jewish theosophy . the fourth chapter , & quot ; tradition and new creation in the ritual of the kabbalists & quot ; presents a solution to a problem faced by each new generation . namely , how are the traditions passed on in a vital and meaningful medium . the mishnal codified jewish religious law and ritual for an agrarian community had survived for centuries . as the agrarian society diminished , the torah became obsolete and the natural rituals became less meaningful , historical rituals . the spanish kabbalists found a new ritual to express the old traditions . scholem writes , & quot ; the rejuvenation of religion repeatedly finds its expression in a return to ancient images and symbols , even when these are 'spiritualized ' and transformed into speculative constructions. & quot ; r. yanassan gershom has already succinctly summarised the fifth chapter which deals with the concept of the golem . i will take the liberty to direct you to his comments . if you are interested in historical issues of the kabbalah , this is essential reading for you"}], "russka": [{"num": 111, "context": "historical fiction at its very best . though this

the beatles , noticed the students movement in 1968 , had no ulbrich or honecker , but chancellor willy brandt and helmut kohl . but i tried to find out the place , where the woman could live , who

been this moved by a work of fiction in a long , long time . i found myself so drawn to charlie and to what was happening to him , to his longing for acceptance and love , and to his quest to make sense of his world . the desire for acceptance and love -- from oneself and from others -- is something all people have in common regardless their iq . i cried as charlie regressed , all the while knowing what was happening to him , realizing the profundity of his loss , yet finally being grateful for the short period of intellect and what that contributed to science . i ca n't disagree more with the reviewer who says the book 's ending was predictable . for a while , i thought the book would be about the trick of combining great intellect with human love . when fay put the female mouse in with algernon , i kept waiting to see if this theme would be played out , first with the mouse , later with charlie . one possible ending would have been to let charlie have his high iq but , unlike algernon , be able to integrate intellect with emotion . another ending would have been to go back to the lower iq , and have a completely sterile existence devoid of anyone . this of course did not happen as the people at the bakery also showed growth by the book 's end and were able to truly take charlie in and befriend him . i think the author came up with a good ending by causing charlie to lose the intellect , but to have gained self-love and the love of others , things he did not have at the start of his journey ."}, {"num": 566, "context": "compelling coming-of-age tale the title of this novel would lead one to believe that it 's about the life of a student in college , but that 's not exactly the case . sure , part of it takes place at college , but in truth it 's more of a coming-of-age story ; a young man 's attempt to reconcile his working class , suburban upbringing with the wealth and intellectual glamour he discovers at prestigious yale university . it 's a well-told and compelling tale , and , like other perrotta novels , leaves one with something to think about at its end . we meet danny in his junior year as he is finally coming into his own . he 's established himself intellectually , he 's got new and interesting friends , and he 's even a bit of a celebrity in that he 's an integral part of a newly-minted literary magazine . it 's now been more than two years since he came to school and his home-town ties are slowly disintegrating . but some are more difficult to abandon than others . his father , for one , owns a lunch truck , or roach coach . in a mid-life change of careers , he 's decided to become his own man , to run his own business . but it is stressful work , and damaging to his health . danny finds that he must spend all his vacation time helping him . then there is the girl danny met from his old high school . she 's a secretary now , at a run-of-the-mill , small industrial plant . he goes out with her knowing full well that the relationship will never blossom into anything . he is aware he is using her . although danny is doing well , grade-wise , he is painfully aware of all of the shenanigans going on around him , some of which he participates in . a girl has basically moved into his suite with one of his roommates . other roommates smoke dope . another spends his time in fascination with assassins of american presidents . everybody drinks way , way too much . one evening , while cavorting with a female on the campus grounds , he is ridiculed by a student-actor dressed as the `` fool '' from shakespeare 's king lear . is this why our parents spend thousands and thousands of dollars a year ? he thinks . with his background , he is able to view these goings-on through the eyes of the average working-stiff american , and without ever explicitly saying why , finds that he is ashamed . his actions , sometimes reckless , sometimes foolish , seem to indicate a subconscious desire to be punished . this conflict is unresolved by novel 's end . it is unlikely that this novel will ever win a pulitzer prize , or even be nominated for one . there is no huge encompassing theme , there are no substantial

is , frankly , the type of thing which present-day aspiring authors should strive for . the average reader is not interested in being dazzled by an author 's research or bombarded with symbolic references to freud , he is interested in being told a good story . if an author does this well enough and often enough , all of those other elements -- the ones which make a novel great -- will fall into place . indeed , they did so in mr. perrotta 's most recent effort , the excellent little children . joe college works because , at the very least , it is a fine example of the art of

most still consider it a pretty fair heinlein yarn , and yet all the reviews i read missed one of the main points of the novel -- which is the main reason why it 's so interesting -- whether it 's a great heinlein novel or not . many have already commented on the various themes of the book , most of which will already be familiar to heinlein fans . the one that was new was the bigotry against the main character , an artificial and genetically enhanced human . it seems most readers found this reaction unlikely , although this theme pervades the entire work . one reviewer asserts that it 's even the primary idea of the whole book . another important theme is the revolt against authority which many heinlein readers will certainly know from his other books such as the moon is a harsh mistress , double star , citizen of the galaxy , stranger in a strange land , sixth column , revolt in 2100 , and others . the theme of the competent man also takes center stage in this book , another famous and familiar heinlein theme , although in this book it 's a competent , genetically enhanced female . however , all these interpretations , although true , miss one very important point . in heinlein 's novels , the world is often a very unstable and even dangerous place -- but there is always hope , and optimism that conditions will be better in the future . often the main characters in heinlein 's books are intimately involved in this struggle to overthrow oppressive governments -- and usually succeeding , thereby creating a better life for themselves . so no matter how precarious and dark life in the present might be , heinlein always had hope for the future and seemed confident that humans would throw off the yoke of oppression , establish a better society , and basically good would win out over evil . but in this novel , he appears to have at least partly , perhaps substantially , abandoned that hope in favor of a much darker , more dismal , and depressing future for humanity , at least on earth . better prospects can be found off-planet on several newly colonized worlds . the evidence for this is n't hard to find , but is scattered throughout the book in various narratives , and in conversations between friday and her boss , dr. baldwin . by the way , kettle belly baldwin has not appeared , to my knowledge , in another heinlein book since gulf , published in 1949 . however , all of the other characters are new . so one of the charms of the book is that one gets to meet a lot of new characters , making this book different from almost all of heinlein 's later output , and an old but memorable character is brought back to life in a new context . but getting back to my point , heinlein makes it clear the earth is economically and politically deteriorating , with most of the world now completely balkanized into hundreds of small , petty states , each with its own unpleasant idiosyncrasies . heinlein says most of these small states are faceless ciphers , with a few larger , powerful states remaining . the u.s. is no different , being divided into several smaller sovereign states , along with canada . but these smaller states are often co-belligerants or are at war with each other . it 's said that peace rarely lasts more than a month . in one coup that occurs in the chicago imperium by militant republicans , democrats are rounded up and executed -- including their children down to the age of 14 . another alarming idea is that the large international corporations , such as ibm or the shipstone corp. , are also participants and instigators of these wars , and sometimes wipe out entire cities , such as acapulco . these corporations are hard to fight , since they have no single geographical location , and in the book , the internationals seem to be winning over the real or geographically `` localized '' countries . these super corporations are completely ruthless and immoral and killing for hire and mass murder by them are common . heinlein holds out little hope the situation will ever improve -- he sees elected officials as venal and corrupt parasites feeding at the public trough and mouthing fatuous platitudes for consumption by an impotent and perhaps naive public -- a much darker and more cynical interpretation of politics than that portrayed in starship troopers , the moon is a harsh mistress , or double star , in which , if i remember correctly , one character remarks that politics is the only game a mature man can take any pleasure in . even con artists and grifters heinlein sees as more noble -- at least they 're hardworking independents who are n't on the dole and are trying to earn an `` honest '' living . : - ) government and personal corruption are also ubiquitous . the police are not to be trusted in the book , and disposing of them if possible is considered a good idea -- as long as one can get away with it , of course . for a client who is powerful and wealthy enough , even physicians can be made to arrange for a certain patient to `` die '' on the operating table . in fact , almost no one in any position of authority -- except friday 's boss , baldwin , seems to be trustworthy . in conversations with her boss , dr. baldwin , he tells friday she needs to get off planet because of what 's happening on earth and asks her how one can tell if a society is truly sick -- that being when normal conventions of politeness and manners have deteriorated into rudeness -- which the people now take as a sign of strength . in the book , the good people always seem to be on the run and are persecuted -- while the evil flourish unhindered . an epidemic of cholera or bubonic plague that could kill millions is predicted , possibly because of a conspiracy . but baldwin sees this as a social good since cities are so overpopulated and dysfunctional already that thinning out the population -- however it is achieved -- is a worthwhile goal . so overall , it seems a darker and more pessimistic future than anything heinlein had ever imagined up to this time . but one of heinlein 's strengths is his ability to create believable alternate realities -- which again comes through here -- however dark and depressing it might be . whether it 's one of his greatest books or not , i think it counts as an unusual and worthwhile heinlein book because of that"}, {"num": 704, "context": "mind opener i first read this book shortly after it was published and it was one that started me on a journey of discovery about natural selection and sexual selection . from being someone who was more focussed on social sciences at last i had discovered a more scientific way of understanding the world that made much more sense . the natural world , human societies and my own family relationships began to connect in a more comprehensible whole . so the best parts of the book for me are those about natural selection and family values rather than the workings of the human mind , though these sections are also a very good read . having read widely since , i know there is far more that needs to be understood . particularly with sexual selection there are a lot of women , like myself , who are aware that female sexuality throughout the animal kingdom is more complex than has been thought with female promiscuity far more prevalent than would be expected with the assumption that a female only needs to mate with one male . also , with human females having concealed ovulation a man could mate with vast numbers of females and never have a single offspring whereas it is the female who needs to be mating a lot when she is ovulating - and not necessarily with only one male . it is only humans that have females producing all their offspring from a single father - in other species , though a male may have exclusive access to a number of females it is never for life and he will be replaced or the female will move to another male . pinker does make clear points about human males owning daughters , sisters and wives and enforcing monogamy on them , which naturally overrides female mate choice . he is not offensive in the way some male writers are when they write as if females are naturally passive and monogamous while males gleefully exploit one female after another . in this book pinker writes better about the sexes than he does in 'the blank slate ' when he writes about rape . though i now know enough to be able to question points in this book , i still think it is an excellent read and would recommend it to anyone and everyone ."}, {"num": 739, "context": "capote : a literary

the score . no one with a true understanding of billie holiday would consider her a blues singer . as such to truly study blues legacies , it would be better if a blues singer like memphis minnie , one of the greatest female instrumental blues singers , were included . surely , dinah washington , justifiably named the queen of the blues , or ruth brown , ( miss or maybe now ms rhythm ) would be more appropriate to a study of black blues women . this hints that the generalizations in this book may be the result of pushing around reality rather than studying it . this is an all too frequent problem in the writing of academics who seem more concerned about creating their own little niche of analysis , than situating their work in the realities of life , culture , and art where the blues or jazz , and billie 's real life live . billie did not like to be called a blues singer . if we are concerned with the voices of black women , then someone involved in this book should have at least had the respect to listen to billie holiday 's voice on the matter . she considered herself a jazz singer and later a cabaret singer . she recorded very few blues . the two blues she recorded again and again `` billie 's blues '' and `` fine and mellow '' were only recorded because in two different recording sessions there was time to record additional songs , but no preparation or charts existed for any song , so an easy to play blues was selected . billie recorded them and performed these two tunes often because she had the author 's credit and publishing on them which made it easier and more profitable . this is despite the fact that the exact word sets had been sung and recorded by real blues singers before billie had the brains to record and copyright them . listen to helen humes sing an exact version of fine and mellow with another name during the first spirituals to swing concert that took place before billie recorded her version . a good contrast with billie , though male , was her friend and often colleague jimmie rushing who served with her in the basie band . despite his penchant for claiming he was a ballad singer as well -- rushing actually thought that when billie left basie that rather than hiring another singer , he alone could fill the gap -- rushing 's recordings with walter page 's blue devils in the 1920s , with moten in the early 1930s , and with basie in the 1930s and 1940s are masterpieces of the blues . many of his renditions like good morning blues have become standards for blusicians of all stripes . lesser known but deserving more attention are his great blues recorded with kc musicians for john hammond on vanguard in the 1960s . otherwise she recorded few blues , particularly in her most artistically developed period between 1934 and 1945 . indeed , billie 's lack of a blues repertoire and disinclination to perform blues cost her her position as female vocalist with the count basie orchestra , a match made in heaven . while there were no doubt other factors involved , many basieites especially buck clayton who was quite close to billy have said billie was replaced because she did n't perform enough blues to suit john hammond who acted as de facto manager and ar man with the basie band . hammond replaced billie holiday with helen humes who had been recording blues for ten years before she joined basie . humes , of course , continued to record blues with basie , and then as an independent singer from then until her death keeping her magnificent jump blues alive for several generations of listeners . clayton 's complaint is a standard one leveled at white jazz producers like hammond and norman grantz that they wanted blues , not more harmonically developed music that black jazz musicians really wanted to play . the blues is a specific genre of african american musical , poetic , and cultural expression with its own distinct history , evolution , and practices . simply collapsing every black performer into the blues makes the blues meaningless and demeans the work of the millions of women and men who have created the blues in the last 110-120 years . another insult to billie , is the tendency to see her as a `` blues figure '' because of her `` tragic '' life . this is the tendency to evaluate billie as the public life disaster that she tended to milk in desperation in the last years of her life symbolized by the fake autobiography _lady sings the blues_ . this contrasts than the artistic consideration she deserved and received from other musicians and singers . she was a competent and practicing jazz artist , raised in the music business ( her father complained he played guitar for every jazz artist in nyc in the 1930s and early 1940s but billie . her mother boarded musicians and catered musical parties ) . from a young age , billie was considered as knowledgeable as the top instrumentalists of the music by those top instrumentalists . those who rely on the `` tragedy '' to induct billie into the blues express a greater ignorance given that as her own drug addiction advanced , her music had less and less of a connection with the blues , climaxing in `` the lady in satin '' which is a vain attempt to take the lady into non-jazz pop . all of her original blues were recorded in her pre-heroin youth in the 1930s , not in the 1950s when billie 's self-made `` tragedy '' had begun to destroy her voice and musicial viability and then her life . it is quite bizarre for anyone to claim billie 's performance of meeropol 's song `` strange fruit , '' has any relationship to blues music given her very straight reading of the tune , the unblueslike straight minor it is given , and the unjazzlike accompaniment . if one wants to see what a blues singer can do to this song , one needs to listen to the astounding version recorded by josh white which is blusey and also more dramatic and satisfying than holiday 's more celebrated version . holiday 's performance of ``

this fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy , let alone female sexuality . it 's also mean-spirited . lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman , and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept . this is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal . he drips way too much contempt . everything outside of sex is dumb , meaningless , ridiculous . attempting to derive enjoyment from the `` mental life '' makes one ridiculous ; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous ; trying to have sex in any way outside lawrence 's own true and correct way makes one pathetic , or defective , or spiteful ; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of `` woman '' or `` man '' ; and so on . looking at italian art is stupid . everything in paris is stupid . constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in france knows how to have sex properly . reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what 's `` wrong '' with everyone except c. and m. , one might easily conclude that constance does n't really seem happier now that she 's sleeping with the gamekeeper , and hilda does seem happier in venice - the author counters this by ridiculing `` that kind '' of happiness as delusional and druglike . he even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there 's something wrong with her . of course constance is wretched , because she does not have that one thing that , in lawrence 's view , really matters in life - not mellors , but mellors ' equipment . this book does degenerate into phallus-worship , which makes the author 's hostility toward `` druglike '' pleasures seem sort of ironically comical . hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures : from venice , from the feel of the sun , from jazz , from dancing . this seems weird to me - as if lawrence is punishing the uppity woman . hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a `` user '' , with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man , only to walk away when the dance is over . ( this may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist , since obviously lawrence does n't mind if mellors is callous and behaves as a `` user '' . ) it 's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one 's body . everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex , but his notion of real sex . this is where astute readers will have the most trouble . lawrence clearly defines a `` real '' woman - constance chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples . a woman who lays there `` unfeeling '' is clearly an example . such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc . lawrence does n't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or is n't doing could even be related ; it 's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically , but in character . on the other hand , a woman with an unfeminine urge to be in control - that is , one who insists on moving herself , rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when michaelis is the male ( because he 's premature , and meant to be pathetic ) , but it turns unforgiveable when it 's women in general and especially mellor 's bertha , who just refused to come when she should out of spite . bertha just had a sick ( ! ) urge to be in control , demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature . the only thing mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he `` spoilt '' her . as for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy ? forget it . lawrence suggests that mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch , but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental , nothing important . a real woman does n't need foreplay . just hop on and go , and if she 's what she ought to be , she 'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later . these were what i found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman 's duty is to lie there , not too passive , but not too active , and come when she 's supposed to ( and if she does n't , it 's her own fault ) ; while a man 's job is to climb on top and `` perform '' . all of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are , unfortunately , not true . the truth is that a woman 's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis ; there 's a thing that both males and females start out with , which in a man becomes the penis , and in the woman becomes ( or remains ) a clitoris . lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part . women have always known about their own bodies ; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things , preferably apart from what women think men `` want to hear '' . this , too , is no doubt why it has been accused of being `` sexist '' . the author ( or at least mellors ) openly blames women who can not or will not `` come to the crisis '' when she ought , as if it were entirely of the woman 's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man . it 's also likely that science will eventually prove ( if it has n't already ) that women like constance chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be ' emotionally as well as physically . for all that lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly , even noxious emotions and desires - such as `` intimacy '' and `` connection '' , both of which he has constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act , but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences , based on the notion that a man 's biological job is to get his dna out there , while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment . if this is true , it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant , not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child . so - while there may or may not be women who feel as constance does , at the same time it 's not so clearly obvious that a woman `` should '' feel that way , as to justify lawrence 's open belittling of women whose emotional states do n't match masculine emotional detachment and distance . there 's a lot of talk of `` tenderness '' - in fact , constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in venice of somehow `` lacking tenderness '' - but quite frankly i am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender . the only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her , but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find . i can imagine a woman putting up with - but i can not imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk , who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal ( remembering she 's a lady ) when she asks him questions , who calls her c -- t as if that were her name , and generally treats her as if she were a whore . i could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of , but this is how their relationship really is ; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he wo n't say and the questions he wo n't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible . for what it 's worth , i think life will be better when this book has become obsolete . it is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages , if not their selves . those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion . as for those who just want a good read - i 'd call it a matter of personal taste . obviously some people enjoy this book .

i also hated how the book shifted `` voices '' -- this is not a play , i do n't want to read monologues describing the same events from a different perspective . i did n't feel as though it was necessary to divide this book into several characters . i half expected a chapter to be from sophie ( delia 's four year old daughter ) perspective . i could really do without the exaggerated and unrealistic jail scenes or the indian lore . i also hated how the entire book seemed to be composed of different memories or thoughts that really made no sense , and then later incorporated into the passage , also not making sense . for example , eric narrates this dream he had about sondra , who is some beautiful girl he imagined . she turns into a rabbit and runs into a bush . later , ruthann tells a story about a rabbit that shoots the sun with a bow and arrow and causes the earth to burn up . somehow he connects the two because of the rabbit , when really they have no cohesive connection . also , between the three childhood friends ( delia , eric and fitz ) they talk about their memories constantly , as if that is the only thing that binds them together . real friendships do n't compromise of only discussing things that happened to them in the past ... but it does in this book , because the author so desperately wants you to know that they are a really close group of friends . to me , it just seems pretentious . what 's also pretentious is the various passages that are supposed to reveal some new idea about life but really make no sense at all . one passage i remember is when delia is talking to fitz about memories and she suggests that maybe everyone has the same memories already in the head from when they are born , and maybe they remember things that never happened to them . i might have that a little wrong , because it 's a bit confusing . it 's confusing because it makes absolutely no sense . it does n't even feel like it 's remotely trying to make sense at all !

( sorry , but sweetbreads , halves of calf heads , and brains were not appetizing subjects . ) also , i gave up finishing the book . i started to read `` an alphabet for gourmets '' , the last section , but got as far as `` d '' and could n't force myself to read through the rest of the alphabet . it seems to me by the time in her life when she wrote this section she had become rather cynical and bitter , to the extent that everything she wrote sounded condescending . this section was such a let-down , a depressant to me after coming off the high of `` the gastronomical me '' . although i exaggerate , she seemed to repeatedly state something to the effect that she preferred to dine alone on crackers and milk rather than face gourmet meals with uncultivated people ( with untrained palettes ) who were unsavvy as to the proper way food should be eaten in the first place and incapable of appreciating what they shoved in their faces in the second . anyway , other readers may disagree with me , but this last section lacks the consistency , and more important , the vibrancy and pep of her flowing , off-the-wall style that grows on you in the other sections . although i was a little disheartened at the end , her brilliance that shone through in the other sections more than outweighed the few negatives . i can recommend this book to everyone , especially to people who are interested in food as a literary subject in its own right instead of something that we simply cook and eat . of course , foodies and cooks alike should appreciate it . and though it does have some very good recipes as added bonuses , this should not be considered a cookbook ; instead , this book 's function is to serve up delicious tidbits for our minds and imaginations to savor and enjoy ."}],

wine in america ' is a great 1500 page compilation of excellently written articles on virtually every aspect of the history , education , manufacture , marketing , personalities , and writing about food in america . practically the only thing it does not include is recipes or cooking . even sidebars whose label suggests a proper place for a recipe such as the sidebar on shoofly pie gives not one hint about how to make this delicious dessert . given the size of the subject , it is not at all surprising that the editors have left these out , as both recipes and kitchen science can both be considered without nationality , plus the fact that there are thousands of good cookbooks and a score of books on food science available today , so why not focus on things which are not commonly covered in these books . this means that this volume can sit beside the `larousse gastronomique ' with only a very small amount of overlap in material . these two giant books have two entirely different objectives . while both works will have articles on potatoes , larousse will tell you how to cook them , but oxford will tell us were they are grown , their commercial importance , nutritional importance , and their appearance in cartoons . so , unlike larousse , you are much more inclined to simply read the articles in these volumes for your own entertainment as much as for your need to know something . the articles are filled to the brim with interesting trivia about american food . one favorite item in the article about spam is the fact that the word `spam ' became associated with junk e-mail on the strength of a monty python skit which did the same kind of number on spam as the movie `blazing saddles ' did on western films . another discovery was the renaming of sauerkraut to `liberty cabbage ' after world war i . in this way , the book follows the style of the encyclopedia britannica that leans heavily toward long , detailed articles rather than shorter articles with a greater chance of redundancy , especially with a hundred or more independent contributors . it would probably take the average foodie about five minutes of searching through these volumes to find something they miss . my first sense of something being missing was when there were articles about charlie trotter , alice waters , and rick bayless , but no articles on thomas keller , jeremiah tower , or richard olney . i would not feel the absence so acutely if the editors had given us biographies on julia child , james beard , craig claiborne , and m.f.k . fisher and stopped there , as all four of these figures are so obviously at the very top of the heap in their influence on american eating and food writing . on the other hand , tower and olney between them are probably as much an influence on culinary professionals in the united states as alice waters . while olney spent much of his life living in france , he was born in iowa and all of his most influential works , most notably his editorship of the time-life culinary series of books in the 1960s was aimed at american audiences . this series is mentioned twice in the long article on cookbooks with no mention of olney as the editor , a position recommended to the publishers by james beard . regarding keller and trotter , for example , both have received the james beard best chef in the country award and of the books attributed to these two chefs , i much prefer the two from keller than the three from trotter which i have reviewed . i suspect the difference in the eyes of the editors is trotter 's earlier ascendancy , his substantial charitable activities , and his better than average culinary instruction tv shows . these quibbles aside , i am genuinely impressed by the overall quality of the writing in the thousands of articles in this work . the biographical articles all begin with a crisp statement of the importance of the subject to american culinary history . in spite of the very large number of writers , all articles seem to share this same matter of factness , with virtually no sentimentality or sensationalism . one joggling act that must have challanged the editors is how to limit the book to `american ' subjects . and , they seem to have accomplished this with great good judgment . in place of any mention of french or italian or japanese or korean or east indian or chinese subjects , the editors have given us articles on `italian-american ' food and `german-american ' food . i know the german-american culinary world better than any other and i give the author of this article high marks for capturing the big picture and not limiting himself to the very easy subject of the `pennsylvania dutch ' cuisine . although the amish and mennonite communities of pennsylvania , ohio , new york , and the carolinas are at the heart of the german / american food tradition , the greater german influence is much broader , overlapping , for example , the jewish-american culinary world and even the influences from france and italy . by far the best use for this work is as a starting point for serious culinary research or simply noodling around the literature of cookery for fun . in addition to the articles with their excellent bibliographies , there are appendices on general food bibliography , general wine bibliography , list of food periodicals and web sites , major food subject reference libraries , major food museums , food organizations , and food festivals . be warned that in spite of the title , wine gets much less than half the volume of ink spilled in these volumes . i also detected a few minor editing mistakes and omissions . the web site for the cable `food network ' is listed as www.foodtv.com , but this was changed close to two years ago to www.foodnetwork.com . this little mistake is less easy to understand since the article on julia child notes her death which occurred about 6 months ago . still , this book is

paragraphs , in tiny letters , onto one page . . . this is one of the books where you have ten paragraphs ( or more ) per page , plus there is so much going on in the story that the plotline is constantly changing . . . for me , this made for some frustrating reading . but as for the story itself - this is my first by allison lane , and what i see , i like . i was pre-warned that she is a ``

'' this comment , paraphrased from philosopher jerry fodor , typifies what daniel dennett has been contending with for many years . although the `` cartesian theatre '' notion , that the body was one aspect of our being and the mind another - `` dualism '' - has supposedly been supplanted , it has not lost its hold on our view of consciousness . we continue to insist , in some form or other , that `` somebody , and it better be me '' is inside our minds looking out at the world . although we ca n't find that `` self '' in there , we have a hunch it 's there . when dennett wrote `` consciousness explained '' in 1991 , it seemed the `` homunculus '' representing our `` self '' had been laid to rest . this excellent collection of essays and lectures , is an update on that earlier work . as lectures , they have a conversational tone , yet impart many deep insights . addressing consciousness through four major themes , dennett shows us the project of eradicating `` dualism '' remains incomplete . until that view of `` self '' is discarded , our understanding of consciousness will remain misleading . the first theme he addresses is the `` zombie '' . philosophers have posed the idea that a duplicate person , identical to you in every way but one , is logically possible . the person would act as you act , talk as you do , have the same preferences and distastes . but it would not be conscious . this proposal presumes that something in you could be identified that is lacking in the zombie . for most of us , who still feel our `` self '' remains somehow separate within us , the logic seems reasonable . dennett carefully examines the implications of the proposal , and dismisses it as modernised dualism . if a region of the brain holds the key to `` self '' it remains out of sight and undetectable . perhaps the most challenging segment of the book deals with `` heterophenomonology '' . this tongue-twisting phrase refers to the methods used in cognitive science . because consciousness is `` often celebrated as a mystery beyond science '' dennett challenges researchers to take a step back from commonly accepted techniques . become a `` martian '' cognitive scientist to broaden the scope of the work . one facet of this approach relies on understanding what `` folk psychology '' is , then building from there . we prefer to believe that what we believe is entirely private and unaccessible . heterophenomonolgy , he contends , will expose aspects of our consciousness we view as a `` mystery '' . one of those `` mysteries '' has been wrapped in the idea of `` qualia '' . probably one of the poorest concepts in philosophy , `` qualia '' are things said to possess `` intrinsic qualities '' . when you carefully examine those `` intrinsic '' properties , they begin to fade and vanish . if `` qualia '' is in an object we see , such as colour , how can it change without our noticing ? tests of `` change blindness '' indicate we can miss much concerning `` qualia '' . even the philosophic community , dennett notes , can not agree on a definition of `` qualia '' . yet , like the homunculus in the mind viewing the world , it steadfastly remains in use . the author examines this idea further in relating the story of `` mary '' , the colour-deprived scientist . in `` consciousness explained '' , dennett proposed the multiple drafts model of consciousness and cognition . in this collection , he enhances the original concept . with no centre in the brain , consciousness necessarily must be a distributed process . the progress of imaging and other technologies have expanded our view of the brain 's functions . dennett argues that the brain is `` fame '' not `` television '' . the process is one of competition for dominance , no matter how fleeting . the mind is not a `` top-down '' or `` bottom-up '' process , but a `` sideways '' one . ideas , experiences and other informational bits jostle for `` clout '' . it 's not easy to shed the idea of a special `` self '' in your mind , but all that 's going on in there is still you . as usual , dennett has challenged successfully the `` established '' views of consciousness . clearly , he argues , consciousness is neither an arcane `` mystery '' nor beyond serious and definitive investigation . the mind-set erecting barricades using the bricks of `` qualia '' and the mortar of the `` cartesian theatre '' can , and must be , overcome for serious investigation to proceed . delicacy and care must be employed , but the prize is understanding .

'' ( 7 ) everyone can write description , but only eddison could write description like this . he makes the colors shine brighter and the shapes of the `` monsters '' stick out in your mind . and even though you may not know what a crystolite looks like , you agree that it fits perfectly into this paragraph . eddison realized that you ca n't a world that mirrors the heroic past if you get stuck in the decidedly un-heroic language of modern times . `` now had they for three days or four a devious journey through the foot-hills , and thereafter made their dwelling for forty days ' space in the zia valley , above the gorges . here the valley widens to a flat-floored amphitheatre , and lean limestone crags tower heavenward on every side . high in the south , couched above great gray moraines , the zia glacier , wrinkle-backed like some dragon survived out of the elder chaos , thrusts his snout into the valley . here out of his caves of ice the young river thunders , casting up a spray where rainbows hover in bright weather . the air blows sharp from the glacier , and alpine flowers and shrubs feed on the sunlight . '' ( 153 ) perhaps it 's because i 'm a mountain-climber myself , but i found juss and brandoch daha 's assault on koshtra pivrarcha to be the most memorable chapter in a book built out of unforgettable chapters . in real life no two mountain ranges are alike , yet most fantasy authors write only staid standard-issue descriptions when they make mountains . eddison understood that for us to see the glaciers , feel the biting cold winds , and experience the exhilaration of reaching the summit with the heroes , he needs to give his mountains some real personality . these samples , of course , only scratch the surface of eddison 's brilliant mix of visceral detail and towering metaphor ; he maintains this level , never flagging , for all two hundred thousand words . but of course `` the worm ouroboros '' could hardly have claimed such a lofty space in the pantheon of imaginative fiction without a plot and character worthy of this lavish writing . on one side king gorice xii of witchland sends his warriors out to crush all opposition and subjugate the entire world to his will . opposing him are the adventure-loving lords of demonland , lead by the magnificent lord juss and his family . the ensuing conflict will rage on land and sea , across continents and mountain ranges . and without any doubt eddison crafts his dialogue with the same mastery he displays in his narration : `` la fireez , '' said juss , `` we weigh not so lightly our obligation unto thee . yet must i hold my course ; having sworn a strong oath that i would turn aside neither to the right nor to the left until i had delivered my dear brother goldry out of bondage . so sware i or ever went that ill journey to carce and was closed in prison fast and by thee delivered . nor shall blame of friends nor wrongful misprison nor any power that is shake me in this determination . but when that is done , no rest remaineth unto us till we win back for thee thy rightful realm of pixyland , and many good things besides to be a token of our love .

history of the arab world . this is too bad , since as history the book is of low quality , with significant problems of organization and , where relevant to hourani 's apparent biases , factual accuracy . it does have its redeeming elements , but on the whole is for a variety of reasons not a reliable source as a general history of the arab world , especially for the beginner . being the author of a general history of the arab world myself , before i explain why i evaluate the book negatively i would like to suggest some alternatives , lest i be accused of attacking a rival publication out of self-interest . philip k. hitti 's the history of the arabs is a very detailed history which runs from pre-islamic times to the 19th century . arthur goldschmidt 's concise history of the middle east covers turkey , iran and israel as well as the arab world and is well-organized for beginners . it was the first general history of the middle east i read as an undergraduate . bernard lewis ' the middle east focuses more on concepts and the flow of history but is also appropriate for those without a strong background in the region . this book was first published in 1991 . this review is based on the 1992 paperback version by warner books . the initial weakness of this book begins with the very first chapter ; although containing 458 pages of main text , hourani 's history devotes a mere seven pages to the pre-islamic period . this is pretty amazing , for anyone familiar with that period , since arab history prior to islam is roughly as long as arab history after it . exactly how far back arab peoples go in history is a matter of dispute , but certainly there were people one could call `` arabians '' as far back as the beginning of the first mellinnium bc , or 1,600 years prior to muhammad . the evidence is sporadic for sure , and no writer would give it equal prominence with later times , but seven pages is pretty paltry . one might suspect an islamic bias here , but the problem continues in the key early periods of islam . the life of muhammad and his immediate successors who established the basis for the muslim world , spanning about a half century from muhammad 's first vision to the death of his son-in-law and successor ali , get only 11 pages . the first arab empire , the umayyads ( 661-950 ) , gets seven pages , and the abbasid empire ( 750-circa . 945 ) , which is usually thought of as the `` golden age of islam , '' gets only six . this means 37 pages for the first 2,000 years of arab history , including its framing epoch , and over 400 pages for the next 1,000 . this would leave the uninitiated reader entirely without much sense of proportion . what makes this book highly unrecommended for the beginner is its weak sense of organization . the middle time period between the collapse of abbasid authority - roughly ad 950 - and the ascendance of the ottoman empire over the arab world in 1517 is intrinsically a difficult time period to understand and a more difficult one on which to write a history . this is due to the fact that rather than there being one dominant power or a few powerful states , there is instead a multiplicity of dynasties with genuine authority in some areas not extending beyond the town level with a multifarious mixture of sunni and shia , arab , persian and turkic ruling groups , not to mention the latin states . hourani makes no serious attempt to help the reader keep all of it straight by moving from a chronological approach prior to 950 to a topical one . there are ten chapters covering this time period and the social history of part of the previous two periods ( the umayyads and the abbasids ) . there is one chapter which discusses the major power struggles of the time . if you want to understand the relative historical roles of the buyids , the fatimids , the zengids , the ayyubids , the mamluks and their contemporaries , read something else . it is within these ten chapters that this book contains its major strength - its `` social history , '' or its description of the development of the arab world . in fact i cited hourani on the social history sections of my own book . in this regard , hourani really is better than the alternatives . over 200 pages of the book is devoted to detailing various aspects of how the arab world came to be prior to the ottomans . so for those who have already read a general history of the middle east or the arab world and want a more specialized knowledge , these chapters are quite useful . i have several objections to how this book handles a variety of issues of current interest . this book was written during a time period when there was a great emphasis on negating certain negative images of arabs and muslims , to the point of deemphasizing any aspect of the arab world which might be interpreted negatively . the word `` jihad '' does n't even have an entry in the index , although it is used , or perhaps , misused . on page 247 , hourani describes a traditional view stipulating that the ruler has an obligation `` to pursue jihad by maintaining the strength of the kingdom 's defense ... '' this gives a misimpression , because legally jihad has two military meanings - the defense of muslim lands and the muslim community 's collective obligation to spread islam through conquest . although jihad has a spiritual as well as martial application , its use is overwhelmingly in the military context , and while muhammad 's battles probably could be described as defensive , the vast majority of military actions between that time and the 19th century involved offensive operations ( the christian counter-offensives known as the crusades being a major exception ) . more broadly , the single most influential islamist movement of the modern age , the wahhabis , get only a few scattered mentions , and there is no real indication of the wave of extremism which by 1991 had been felt for some time . the primary non-islamist ideological influence , marxism , is discussed of course , but the influence of nazism during the 1930s and 1940s is left out . nazi germany is mentioned once in passing , and in the same paragraph on page 331 palestinian leader amin husseini is mentioned , but it is n't mentioned that he was a strong supporter of nazis , that he moved to germany during the second world war and played an active role in the holocaust , or that despite this he was made leader of the palestinian cause by the nascent arab league after the war . hourani 's account of the 1967 is incredibly inaccurate , giving the impression that egypt engaged in some bluster and then israel started the war . he mentions nasser 's demand that the un clear out of the suez canal zone , and includes the defense pact with jordan , but omits a key fact - the mobilization of egyptian forces in the sinai . once egypt did this , israel had no choice but to attack , because of its small population its economy could not handle an extended mobilization , while egypt could . hourani also does n't mention the statements by arab leaders to the effect that all jews would be wiped out in the coming war . on the whole , this is a useful book if one already has a framework understanding of arab history and if one understands the slant that is being presented on issues of contemporary concern . otherwise , i do not recommend buying it"}], "rasimus": [{"num": 277, "context": "brilliant thud memoire the f-105 is a most fascinating aircraft . a superb cold-war design ; it was meant to

to a use in the air war over vietnam . the thud was never meant to be a precision dive bomber , or to pass through heavily defended areas at subsonic speeds . all the same , politicians dictated this

of various of his team , and those who came after . you can practically smell the oil on the tarmac , and the blackpowder charges which combat-started the '105 's engines . while americans would

tale replete with rich detail pros : development of setting , characters , and interweaving stories . cons : some might find the degree of detail too heavy and slowing . i usually start by describing some of the plot , but the story-lines are only about a third of this book 's considerable charm . so . . . the setting : this is an alternate history tale , as far as the setting goes . it takes place on earth , and more preciously in ( what is left of ) england . but , this earth had no ice age , it was struck by an object ( popularly believed to have been a meteor ) that caused the sundering ( the seas rose , the land was mostly submerged , cultures lost touch with one another , the climate changed drastically ) , and humans live side-by-side with mastodons , mammoths , glyptodonts , and other creatures that did not perish ( because there was no ice age ) . the result is an isolated england , that retains much of its past , but has culturally evolved away from what it is ( to us ) . the characters : i am not sure that i have ever read another book that is populated by this many quirky , interesting , amusing , well-developed characters . these are very realistic people , living in a surreal time . even their names are colorful , quirky , and interesting : dr. pinches , mrs. matchless , mr. threadneedle , tim christmas . the characters and the writing speak strongly of a dickensian influence , but is definitely also just plain jeffrey barlough 's . the plots : yes , i did say `` plots '' in the plural . there are three , distinct story-lines , that share some characters and the same setting and time period . the woes of ms. jane wastefield is what i would entitle one story-line , wherein a beautiful young woman receives a birthday present that terrifies her father to death and then haunts her every waking moment . how can she be rid of the fiendish thing ? ! who can help her ? everyone wants to , but no one seems to know how . will she succumb ? would defeat be as terrible as she fears ? and what about her pet monkey ? the wizarding notions would be a good title for the story-line about mr. threadneedle , his apprentice tim christmas , and whatever they are tinkering with out in the coach-house . can they make it work ? will everyone be shocked ? will anyone believe them , without seeing the finished product ? will mr. threadneedle find some peace and enjoyment , if he succeeds ? the secret of the will is what bothers another set of characters . when rich old joseph cargo died , he left most of his estate to his favorite nephew , but who is jerry squailes , and why does he get one-fourth of the money ? no one knows , and young frederick cargo , spurred on by his shrewish wife and aided by their elderly , honest attorney , mr. liffey , go on a mission to uncover the truth . will they like the truth , when and if they find it ? will that thing kill any of them before they do solve the mystery of jerry squailes , the unknown heir ? my take : this book is some of the best escapist reading i have ever found . the world described is so different ( but not ) and so replete with interesting characters , that it becomes a great place to retreat to . the writing is very detailed , with tremendous development of setting , characters , and the interweaving stories . it is truly a fascinating journey to take , and the ending ( s ) is not how hollywood or fairy tales would do it , with a panoply of happily-ever-after . however , it is also not depressing . this tale is just plain well done . the

ironic twist . a collection of 100 or more short stories by o. henry ? my mouth waters already ! it 's hard to imagine any literary treat that can be enjoyed in small doses more pleasurable than this . i have spent over a year savouring these stories , reading them one by one , tasting his delightful choice of words , digesting his fascinating story-lines , and the warm satisfying afterglow that comes after a typical twist at the end . o. henry began writing short stories as a prison inmate , and he quickly fine tuned his skills behind the bars and developed into an excellent storyteller . born william sydney porter ( 1862-1910 ) , he produced 270 stories under the pseudonym o. henry . his stories are superbly outstanding in at least four ways , each illustrated with five of my personal favorites . firstly , his brilliant use of language . these stories were written in the first half of the twentieth century , and o. henry 's use of language easily surpasses that of most contemporary writers . not only does he have an extensive vocabulary , but his writing abounds with similes and metaphors that breathe sparkling life and depth into his stories , marred only by the occasional `` lordy '' . `` ulysses and the dogman '' is a fine example of his skills with a language , metaphorically portraying dog owners as victims of circe , in a hopeless enchantment to their leashed pets . also exemplary is `` madame bo-peep of the ranches '' where a ranch manager has a heart fenced by barbwire just like the ranch on which he lives , and yet the twist at the ending suggests that perhaps we were completely mistaken . `` a comedy in rubber '' uses wonderfully elevated language to farcically portray a class of people today known as ambulance chasers . and `` sisters of the golden circle '' revolves around the profound bond that exists between two married women who are strangers but yet sisters `` of the plain gold band . '' `` an unfinished story '' employs profound metaphors of angelic hosts to tell the tragic story of poor dulcie 's struggle for survival . secondly , his unique insight into the social conditions of his time . o. henry has a great understanding of the trials of the lower class , and he frequently pictures the lives of ordinary people of early twentieth century america with warm and sympathetic colours . his characters are frequently the overlooked : the struggling shop girl , the unsuccessful artist , the impoverished . admittedly , some of his images can be hard to comprehend for modern readers , and the distance that time has placed between us and o. henry 's beloved new york means that some of his verbal pictures will be harder to understand and identify with . but his genuine sympathy for the oppressed can not be missed . `` the gift of the magi '' is the signature o. henry story , probably his most famous tale which recounts a poor young couple who both give up a prized possession in order to purchase a gift for one another - but ironically a gift intended to complement the other 's prized possession that they have just given up . another story which display his ability to picture the social conditions of his time - but always with the trademark twist - is `` the pendulum '' , a wonderful portrait of the daily routines of an poor couple and the bursting anxiety of a married man , until the bubble bursts . `` the cop and the anthem '' was the first o. henry story i ever read , and humorously recounts the unsuccessful attempts of a man to get into jail for the winter - it remains vivid in my mind as a memorable favorite . `` the furnished room '' is a tragic and shocking story of suicide , depicting the depths of despair and desperation of the impoverished . thirdly , his warm humour . o. henry has an uncanny ability to portray the mundane and the ordinary in the most elevated language . frequently he pits two characters together in a remarkable way so that one outshines and complements the other . and on other occasions he crafts the most ingenious and humorous schemes for outwitting others . one of his most popular stories is `` the handbook of hymen '' , recounting the tale of two men in a winter cabin , one armed with the hilarious herkimer 's handbook of indispensable information . and then there is o. henry 's fictional character jeff peters , a man who comes with the most ingenious money-making schemes , two shining examples displayed in `` jeff peters as a personal magnet '' and `` the exact science of matrimony '' . `` let me feel your pulse '' pokes fun at doctors , while in `` next to reading matter '' an overly eloquent character wins the heart of a senora with streams of articulate talk about the mundane . fourthly , his ironic twist . one of the distinctive characteristics of o. henry 's short stories is the ironic twist at the end , which never fails to surprise and entertain , sometimes reversing the entire story line in a concluding one-liner . o. henry 's suspense and trademark ironic twist ensures that readers who have a good literary taste in short stories will not be disappointed . like the jeff peters stories , `` the love-philtre of ikey schoenstein '' also feature a brilliant scheme - but a scheme of romance - and the way it backfires is unforgettable . other delightful examples of ordinary stories with a glorious ironic twist include `` witches ' loaves '' and `` while the auto waits '' . the twist that comes at the end of `` the hypotheses of failure '' is so perplexing , that you 'll have to re-read the entire story after reading the ending - but completely delighted at the way in which o. henry has misled you . but perhaps one of o. henry 's best uses of the ironic twist comes in `` the last leaf '' , a warm and tragic tale describing how a dying artist proves as resilient as the last leaf on the wall outside , and through the self-less sacrifice of another . the wordsworth collection is superlative , because it contains more than 700 pages of literary gems . it consists of 100 stories , showcasing a wide range of o. henry 's short-story talents . a few popular favorites are missing , such as `` schools and schools '' , `` shearing the wolf '' , `` the green door '' , and `` the pimienta pancakes . '' but the reality is that nearly all o. henry 's stories feature his trademark ironic twist , as they do his warm humour , his unique insight into the social conditions of the time , and his brilliant use of language , and that every story in this collection is a literary delight worthy of inclusion . the inaccessibility of some references for modern readers does not prevent these stories from being always entertaining and enduring ! do n't pass up on these ! - godly gadfl"}, {"num": 902, "context": "the civil war mr foote has written about the `` war between the states '' . he tells the story of the war . it is not the story of slavery or its demise , not about the country 's explosive economic growth that ensued , not about a lot of other subjects , just about the war and the men who led it and fought it . if you want to experience the ghastlyness that millions of americans did in 1862 to 1865 , read these books . no one has done this better ."}], "stochastics": [{"num": 322, "context": "practical , yet somewhat naive this book teaches you the best way to make money in the markets = confluence of levels combined with price action triggers . he teaches you almost everything on the market 's technical behavior . the naive part is that he uses , in my humble opinion , old school indicators - like 50sma and 200sma . also , he relies on stochastics as an oscillator to show him overbought and oversold conditions . of course , i wish this were true but i think in today 's more volatile conditions - there should be more than that . so what does there need to be ? i do n't know , but let me tell you one important thing : just because you see tons of charts on his book with stochastics on overbought and then prices immediately pulling back , do n't let that fool you into thinking that 's how the market is _always_ going to behave . it 's an excellent primer because this is how discretionary traders should trade , simple yet effective , but sometimes i think it 's a bit too much on the simple side . 4/"}], "overbought": [{"num": 322, "context": "practical , yet somewhat naive this book teaches you the best way to make money in the markets = confluence of levels combined with price action triggers . he teaches you almost everything on the market 's technical behavior . the naive part is that he uses , in my humble opinion , old school indicators - like 50sma and 200sma . also , he relies on stochastics as an oscillator to show him overbought and oversold conditions . of course , i wish this were true but i think in today 's more volatile conditions - there should be more than that . so what does there need to be ? i do n't know , but let me tell you one important thing : just because you see tons of charts on his book with stochastics on overbought and then prices immediately pulling back , do n't let that fool you into thinking that 's how the market is _always_ going to behave . it 's an excellent primer because this is how discretionary traders should trade , simple yet effective , but sometimes i think it 's a bit too much on the simple side . 4/"}], "tregarth": [{"num": 326, "context": "the start of one of the world 's great fantasy series how many times have you fallen asleep and dreamt you were in the fantasy world created by your favorite author ? i 've only had that experience once in my life and my dream took place in andre norton 's witch world . this author kept me turning the pages , not only for the cliff-hangers that the hero , simon tregarth gets himself into , but also for glimpses of a strange new , magical landscape . she does n't pile on the adjectives , either . her prose is remarkably clean . just read the lead sentence of `` witch world , '' which introduces us to ex-soldier , simon tregarth : `` the rain was a slantwise curtain across the dingy street , washing soot from city walls , the taste of it metallic on the lips of the tall , thin man who walked with a loping stride close to the buildings , watching the mouths of doorways , the gaps of alleys with a narrow-eyed intentness .

( these statistics are scrupulously hidden by the leftist news media . ) what have we realized from this expenditure ? first of all , state money diverted to these two deseg cases was stolen from every school district in missouri not participating in a deseg case . small , rural school districts routinely spend between $ 4,000 and $ 5,500 per pupil each year . in st. louis , the per-pupil expenditure has been as high as $ 11,711 : yet , those rural , so-called `` out-state '' districts do a far better job of educating and graduating students , despite having half the resources . ( i 'm sure in kozol 's mind they are merely `` goyim , '' and deserve no better ... ) ironically , while less affluent `` out-state '' districts were robbed of state funding by deseg , the wealthier school districts in st. louis county experienced a massive windfall from deseg : since they are reimbursed by the state the average per-pupil cost for each city transfer , ( rather than their `` marginal '' cost , ) wealthy districts such as clayton , ladue and parkway benefited from a massive infusion of new revenues , although these school districts have traditionally out-spent almost every other missouri district by a factor of three or more . ( for example , clayton currently spends about $ 15,000 per pupil per year . ) achievement in the slpss , half the students test at the 20th percentile or lower on nationally standardized tests . this stat would be even worse , except that ( i am told ) the `` ld '' ( or `` learning disabled '' ) kids do not take the standardized tests . there are legions of ld kids ... in a rare moment of wisdom and sobriety , a federal judge sitting on our deseg case ordered a test of its efficacy in the early 1990s . that study , called the `` lissitz study '' revealed that city students ( i.e. , black students ) bused to predominately white county school districts improved less academically than did every other category of student in the slps . that is , they improved less than students in all-black , the `` naturally '' -integrated , and `` magnet '' schools . when the educational testing service still `` normed '' the sats between 400 and 1600 , the average slps student had a combined sat of 760 . worse yet , these were the best and most motivated students , with further educational aspirations , who `` self-selected '' themselves to take the sats and were therefore , a highly `` skewed '' sample relative to the average slps student . deseg is almost universally motivated by the laughable paradigm that , if we throw enough money at our inner-city schools , black kids will achieve at a level commensurate with white kids . now that even william coleman has repudiated his own research on this subject , ( `` the coleman report , '' cited in `` brown v. board , '' ) kozol and deseg 's other defenders could spend their time far more productively by studying the lessons of `` the bell curve '' in order to understand academic disparities between the races . vested interests it has been remarked that the defenders of deseg will never relent until the last white kid has been driven from the system . this is because the naacp legal defense fund is a `` co-plaintiff '' in most ( if not all ) u.s. deseg cases , and is periodically distributed `` legal expenses '' by the federal courts . these are a very important source of revenue to the naacp , which has experienced declining membership and numerous financial scandals over the last several decades . similarly , deseg has meant a great deal more than the mindless expenditure of billions to bus students around . one of the most injurious elements of the st. louis deseg plan has been a massive affirmative-action program for administrators and teachers . the slpss now employ more functionally illiterate individuals than the n.b.a. , and have become nothing less than an employment agency for lazy and incompetent blacks with political connections . essentially , the same black women who , 30 or 40 years ago were employed in middle-class households as `` domestic '' help , are now slps teachers and administrators . ( `` i is a teacher . '' ) how anyone who never really absorbed a high school education could be presumed able to teach mystifies all but kozol and deseg 's other defenders . if teachers and administrators in the slpss were required to take the s.a.t.s , more than half would test significantly below average : we know this because they have already demonstrated the fact ! approximately half of all slps teachers and about 60 % of its administrators attended harris-stowe state teacher 's college , which has the second lowest academic standards of any institution of `` higher learning '' in missouri . last time i called their admissions office , i was told that harris-stowe accepted applicants with a combined sat of 780 . it should come as no surprise that recent measures of slps student sats do not differ significantly from those of many of their teachers . hypocrisy a truly fascinating phenomenon i have observed is that there seem to be few defenders of deseg among those whose kids actually participated in such a program . it does n't take a parent long to understand that deseg is n't so wonderful when your kid gets rolled for his lunch money every day , or your daughter gets beaten up because she wo n't date outside her race . now kozol may not have kids , but i 'll just bet that if he does , they did not participate in any voluntary deseg programs , if any were available where he resides . ( the jews are mustard for this sort of thing , as long as they are merely allowed to posture and it does n't actually cost them anything ... ) i once had the rare opportunity to sit next to dr. susan uchitelle , the jewish woman who headed the st. louis deseg 's `` voluntary inter-district coordinating council '' throughout the 1980s and 1990s . ( she was paid $ 60,000 per year , but from what i could discern , her sole responsibility seemed to be running interference with the news media , so the rubes out there would n't get the wrong idea about the joys and benefits of deseg whenever there was a stabbing , gun-shot incident , murder , or race riot . ) i considered it an `` opportunity '' because i was able to ask her a question that no one had ever had the impertinence to ask of her before : `` have any of your children participated in the voluntary transfer program ? '' ( that is , were her kids , who would have been `` poster children '' for the county-to-city deseg program , allowed to transfer from their all-white county schools in order to be voluntarily bused to inner-city schools ? ) what do you think was the answer , oh gentle reader ? your response to this question may have far-reaching implications for your understanding of the world around you and some varieties of its inhabitants , such as jonathan kozol ...

'' this is a type of religious crap that this book dispells . is n't it true that none of us are righteous ; even our righteous acts are like filthy rags to the lord ? then are we categorizing sin by saying that homosexuality can destroy a nation , but the hateful attitude of a right-wing pastor can not ? if christians who tithe are to be blessed by god , then why have some 'tithers ' went bankrupt , while some athiests ( and christian false-teachers ) become million-aires ? did 9/11 happen because of the liberal and homosexual communities , as said jerry falwell and pat robertson ? or did it in fact happen because w and the family have gotten in bed financially with saudi arabia and other muslim nations , none of which give a rats a__ about america , and even profited from 9/11 when america spent billions on weapons and defense programs ... .. run by saudis . only a true biblical view of the causes and lessons of suffering can help our walk with god to be more fruitful . you 'll find no faith/health/prosperity quick fixes in this one . you 'll also find nobody on this earth who knows all the answers . this book definitely gives power to that journey with jesus christ , however . just wondering ... . a reviewer of this book has declared a `` chinese victory over the usa '' , and that china is a 'more christian nation ' . woa , dude . they must have better drugs in china too , apparently"}, {"num": 1388, "context": "obviously yancey is a pop psychologist who has no respect for the bible mr. yancey has no respect for the teaching of the bible . god is always there when it hurts . in fact , god allows hurt . look at book of job . god allowed satan to kill job 's children ( ! ! ! ) and tempt his wife away from job and give job a horrible disease . god was always there . in fact , god was a part of the plan to cause job to suffer . why ? on a whim . satan said that job would lose faith if disaster struck him , so god said , `` okay , give it your best shot ! '' sometimes , god sends disasters into your home for a whim , for a wager with satan . this is the lesson from the book of job . sometimes , god himself brings pain and death because christians refuse to uphold the interests of the kingdom of christ . look at the book of jeremiah . it was god who chose to kill israelites , destroy the jerusalem temple . in fact , jeremiah specifically states that king nebuchadnezzar of babylon , who was not a believer , was anointed by god to bring destruction . it 's like god anointing bin laden to destroy america . that would be the similar analogy in terms of anointing a hostile unbeliever to destroy a believing nation . the bible is clear that god chose king nebuchadnezzar to destroy the jerusalem temple and kill israelites . and anyone who opposed king nebuchadnezzar opposed god himself . how does this apply to bin laden . this is how seriously god takes desecration of his house , the christian church . god will raise up an unbelieving enemey to destroy america if america desecrates god 's houses . and opposing this anointed enemy would be opposing god himself . mr. yancey should think seriously about what god teaches about suffering . god gives suffering when believers desecrate his house . god sends death and destruction when christians refuse to uphold the interst of christ . this is an important lesson for america to

( is this indicative of keynes ' own personal organization and logical thinking ? ) within the book , he makes a very practical ( but politically infeasible ) argument for a non-vindictive treaty . he basically suggests that the allies should forget both about reparations and repayment of wartime debts from the other allies , and instead they should settle ( though not ideally ) for frontier adjustments and confiscation of only german gov't property . ( did the german gov't sponsor keynes ' work in writing this book ? ) keynes argues that a crushing reparations burden on the german people would disincent them to produce anything beyond a mere subsistence minimum and discourage entrepreneurial enterprise . there is some logic in this point ; however , later on he goes on to state that the us should forgive its $ 10 billion debt to its wartime allies ( $ 5 billion of which was owed by the uk ) . forgive me if i 'm wrong , but does n't such a move disincent american entreprises from entrepreneurship as well . it 's extremely hypocritical that the allied gov'ts desperately sought loans from the us during the war and then once it was over to claim that they could n't pay them . if they did n't want to repay , then they should n't have borrowed the money - period .

( nash , 110 - 114 ) he also showed how the piedmont inhabitants of the carolinas had to struggle for their rights to live life as they saw fit as well . ( nash , 73 - 79 ) in the case of the `` green mountain boys , '' their struggle proved to be more successful than the struggle of the carolina piedmont , whose insurrection was brutally suppressed by then colonial governor of north carolina , william tryon . nash also shows how this sector of the population became mobilized politically during the course of the revolution . in nash 's estimation , these people were spurred on by the rhetoric of equality in society , as championed by the founding fathers in the countless tracts and pamphlets that were produced during the revolutionary war era . in pennsylvania , the 1776 state constitution was heralded by nash as a true revolutionary document because of its unicameral legislature , its weak executive , and its attempt to limit an amassing of wealth within the state . he also praised the fact that artisans and lower sorts also played such a vital role in the forming of the new state constitution . ( nash , 271 - 286 ) in states where the constitution did adhere to these premises , nash equated it with a betrayal of the will of the people , as evident by the problems massachusetts had in ratifying their state constitution because of its more conservative outlook . ( nash , 302 - 304 ) the talk of freedom and equality also spread , according to nash , to the black population in the american colonies . these ideals not only spread to the free black portion of the population , but also to the thousands of enslaved blacks throughout the land . this spread of ideas to the black population , particularly the enslaved portion , troubled white leaders , according to nash ( nash , 59 ) what was more troubling to the white slave owners was their perception that slave restlessness and even revolt was on the rise . ( nash , 37 - 39 ) what else was truly troubling to many slave holders was that the british actively recruited the slaves to fight against their masters - and all other rebels to the british crown . ( nash , 157 - 164 ) nash contributed much of the awareness of the enslaved to their plight the rise rising literature of freedom that the founding fathers were disseminating across the land . nash believes that this rhetoric , and its implications , were inescapable to the slaves . ( nash , 64 ) he also showed us the aftermath of the revolution for those slaves who sided with the british ; they were transported off either to nova scotia or to the caribbean islands where they were subjected to an even harsher form of slavery than on the mainland . ( nash , 426 - 427 ) women also were praised in this work , as nash pointed out how crucial this sector of the population was throughout the course of the conflict . first , women were important to execute the boycotts that were prevalent in the preceding years of the revolution . nash argued that without their co-operation in the boycotts , the measures would not have proved effective . this is because women had a great deal of involvement in the running of the household and much of the purchasing power was in their hands . if they did not adhere to the boycotts , the measure would have failed , in nash 's estimation . ( nash , 141 - 144 ) nash also illustrated how the women of the revolution became active during the war , specifically in response to rising prices for necessities . nash showed us the response of many women in the boston area to thomas boylston , a merchant whose prices on goods rose as the war progressed . in response to these rising prices , women marched on boylston 's shop , and the shops of other merchants throughout the colonies , to procure the basic necessities for their families at what they deemed equitable prices . ( nash , 232 - 235 ) the plight of the american indians was also great as land speculators and land hungry colonists swarmed over the appalachian mountain range to claim and settle upon lands that were seen as belonging to various indian nations . nash showed us how the natives resisted this encroachment upon their lands through a myriad of tactics , from essentially engaging in bushwhacking warfare with the colonists who encroached upon their lands , ( nash , 253 - 255 ) to the fact that many indian nations chose to align themselves with the british in their cause to suppress the rebellion . ( nash , 151 - 157 ) what was more alarming to nash is the colonists ' `` genocidal '' policies towards the native population . ( nash , 377 - 381 ) although it may not seem like it , there is an underlying premise to nash 's illustrations in the struggles of all of the aforementioned groups during the american revolution . that premise with nash , at first alluded to , and then by the end of the book , states bluntly is class warfare . there is , however , a very real problem in this marxist outlook on american society during the era of the revolution , specifically that the colonists did not view the class structure in the same light that we do today , or even as class was viewed in when karl marx wrote his tracts on such matters . as gordon wood pointed out in his work , the radicalism of the american revolution , `` the social distinctions and economic deprivations that we today think of as the consequence of class divisions , business exploitation , or various isms - capitalism , racism , etc . - were in the eighteenth century usually thought to be caused by the abuses of government . '' ( wood , 5 ) wood also pointed out that there were complexities and variations to american society , which fell along `` local , regional , sectional , ethnic and class differences . '' these complexities made , `` any generalization about americans as a whole , '' quite difficult . ( wood , 6 ) wood further illuminated the difficulties of following such a class distinction as nash proposed in his work . wood stated in his review on nash 's work in the `` new republic online '' : nash 's evidence for popular resistance to all this class exploitation is the incidents of rural rioting and urban mobbing that took place in the decade or so leading up to the revolution . this mobbing and rioting is exceedingly familiar to historians , who have produced a literature about it . unfortunately , these phenomena do not support nash 's argument . not only did the rural rioting have little or nothing to do with the revolution , but the urban mobs , which were indeed directed at british authority , did not represent the class upheaval that nash assumes . the rural riots all arose out of peculiar local circumstances , and were hardly expressions of some sort of coherent class warfare . ( wood , `` new republic online review ) wood , in his review of nash 's work , went on to illustrate exactly what constituted the true dividing lines in american society when he stated : but what of all the rhetoric about the laboring people contesting the aristocratic few that nash draws on to make his case for class warfare ? there was indeed a serious division in eighteenth-century american society that reverberated through the northern states over the succeeding decades , but it was not the one that nash describes . instead of being divided between a rich upper class and a poor working class , as nash sees it , anachronistically anticipating a later nineteenth-century division between employers and employees , eighteenth-century american society was in fact still divided between a leisured gentry and the mass of artisans and other laborers who worked with their hands -- many of them the businessmen of the future . in nash 's work , he viewed many of the revolutionaries as having ulterior motives for their proclamations of equality and freedom . nash , i would argue , hinted toward the idea that the founding fathers only took part in the revolutionary movement to benefit themselves . throughout the course of the book , nash takes great care to `` expose '' the double standards of the founding fathers , making them seem as if they merely wanted to continue their `` elitists '' lifestyle at the expense of the commoners below . there is no bigger whipping boy for nash than john adams , who , according to nash , was essentially a closeted monarchist who was afraid of the people . to be sure , adams did have his reservations about the people , but it was more a fear of a `` tyranny of the masses '' than it was an outright fear that the people would displace the leaders of the new nation . however , what is truly ironic is that nash relied so heavily upon the writings of john adams to illustrate many of his points . not only did he rely on adams ' writings , but also the writings of many of the other founding fathers . throughout the course of the book , when nash referred to any of the writings of the founding fathers , i found myself wondering if nash was cropping their words to support his case . it is my belief that this is something that seriously needs to be explored in greater depth than i can provide here . what is also ironic is that nash makes little use of the narratives of those whose stories he claimed he wanted to tell . outside of the use of joseph plumb martin 's narrative of his experiences as a soldier in the continental army during the war and the autobiography of ethan allen , he does not make extensive use of the diaries and letters of many people who lived through the war experience , both in the military and in the civilian sector . to be sure , there are many diaries out there from those below who can illuminate their thoughts throughout the era . would their writings bear out what nash proposed ? nash criticized the continental congress for not being able to pay the soldiers their salaries . this inability to pay the soldiers wages stemmed from the fact that the government was essentially broke : they were unable to levy taxes on the people of the colonies because of the weak governmental structure from which they operated and many of the colonies did not pay their fair share of the financial burden of the revolution . when robert morris tried to restore fiscal responsibility to the war effort and raise revenue to provide pay and necessities to the army , nash viewed it as an attempt to `` tame the social and political radicalism of the revolution . '' ( nash , 367 ) however , i suppose nash chose to forget the fact that morris was trying to get revenue to provide for the war effort . why then would thomas paine , one who nash seemed to have great respect for his principles of democracy , agreed to author a pamphlet on behalf of robert morris in favor of his new fiscal plan . ( nash , 395 ) if morris ' plan was so stifling to democracy , intended to roll back the radicalism of the revolution , then why would paine agree to be a party to it ? not all of these explanations and questions would mesh well with nash 's outlook on morris and the founding fathers at large . further , if the founding fathers truly wanted rule for themselves , there was no better chance for one of them to establish it than with the `` newburgh conspiracy . '' it is true that the soldiers and officers of george washington 's army were deeply distraught by the ineffectual abilities of the congress to pay wages and provide for basic necessities . ( nash , 370 - 371 ) however , what nash failed to mention is the other half of the conspiracy . the men wanted to march on the continental congress and put george washington in power . washington , through an impassioned speech and performance , quelled all of these thoughts and possibly saved the revolution once again . nash , as stated previously , believed the struggle of the thousands of black slaves in the colonies was heightened by the revolutionary rhetoric that littered the landscape of the era . he believed that such literature raised their awareness and caused more unrest and rebellion than at any time previously . however , i would like to offer my own take on this . did it take pamphlets from the founding fathers to raise the awareness of the enslaved that there was something unnatural about their situation ? i certainly think not . frederick douglass ' autobiography indicates that from a very early age , he was well aware that there was something wrong with the situation he found himself . in an illustration , a still teenage douglass talked with some of his young white friends on the streets of baltimore and they complained about their lot in life . douglass illustrated the point when he wrote , `` you will be free as soon as you are twenty-one , but i am a slave for life ! '' ( douglass , 53 ) while douglass certainly is an exceptional individual , i doubt that this same premise was lost on the countless enslaved individuals in the colonies and that they wanted freedom and it did not take pamphlets for that realization to come to mind . nash lamented the `` genocidal policies '' towards the amerindians adopted by many colonists during the revolution . while it is true that atrocities were committed against the natives , first , this was nothing new by this point in american history . warfare between the natives and colonists was an almost constant from the time that european settlers stepped onto the new world . in such a climate , atrocities committed by both sides in this armed and almost perpetual struggle were inevitable . however , nash is somewhat disingenuous when he makes the native population seemingly innocent or justified in their actions . although nash admitted that the british courted and armed the native peoples to fight the colonists , even after the revolution was over , he can not seem to find any justification for the colonists to meet force with force . lastly , as stated previously , nash bemoaned how historians and the people at large have lost the viewpoint of those below the founding fathers - how the great men still consistently dominant the narrative on the american revolution . ( nash , xv ) first , i would ask mr. nash , `` should we discount what the `great men ' did during the war ? '' while historians do deal with the `` great men '' of the american revolution , i doubt there is one serious historian out there who would discount the actions and sacrifices that were made by the people below . their deeds do not go unnoticed in narratives of the war . we read about the boston tea party , we read about the non-importation of british goods and how the participation of the common people was vital to such an enterprise . we read about the plight of the continental soldier as they nearly starve and free to death in the service of their country . what nash further discounted was the explosion over the past decades in dealing with various social aspects of the history of the revolution . bruce chadwick 's piece , the first american army : the soldiers of the american revolution , he offered the reader a look into the world of the solider in the continental army through their diaries , letters and records . through these written records , we are presented with the bleak situation that so many found themselves in - conflicting interests between home and duty , the want of food and clothing , and their battle experiences . alfred young , in the shoemaker and the tea party , offers a glimpse into the world of the common man on the streets , taking part in demonstrations and actions against the british and their oppressive measures . women 's roles in the revolution are far from ignored . mary beth norton authored a book , liberty 's daughter 's : the revolutionary experience of women : 1750 -1800 , dealing specifically with the trials and tribulations of the women during the american revolution , both from the patriot side and the loyalist side . linda kerber also wrote a piece on women in the american revolution entitled , women of the republic : intellect and ideology in revolutionary america , which also draws upon the revolutionary experience of women through their diaries , letters and legal papers . the native americans receive their fair share of print as well . alan taylor wrote divided ground : indians , settlers , and the northern borderland of the american revolution , which offers a rich , sprawling history focusing on the iroquois six nations of new york and upper canada during the era of the american revolution . taylor examines indians ' wise but unsuccessful attempts to hold onto their land as colonists encroached on it . colin calloway , in his work , the american revolution in indian country : crisis and diversity in native american communities , explored the internal strife that the revolution brought to indian nations involved with the american revolution . the african-american population in the revolutionary era also received a fair amount of print about their ordeals . glenn knoblock wrote , strong and brave fellows : new hampshire 's black soldiers and sailors of the american revolution : 1775 - 1784 , which explored the military careers of over 200 black military officers during the american revolution and attempted to reconstruct their ordeal throughout the conflict . sylvia frey , in her book , water from a rock : black resistance in a revolutionary age , explored the triangular relationship between the british , the americans , and slaves in the south . through this triangular relationship , frey attempted to illustrate the complex and confusing options presented to the slaves in the south during the rebellion . beyond the founders : new approaches to the political history of the early american republic , edited by jeffrey palsey offers readers an alternative reading in the same light that nash presents , the conflicting desires of the myriad of peoples during the american revolution . the political historians contained in this work showed that the early history of the united states was not just the product of a few `` founding fathers , '' but was also marked by widespread and passionate popular involvement ; print media more politically potent than that of later eras ; and political conflicts and influences that crossed lines of race , gender , and class . thus , this work is not beholden to one particular point of view on the revolution , as nash is guilty of being caught up in . these are just some of the books out there on the myriad of topics that nash covered and , to be sure , there are many more . these books are not hard to find . just do a search on amazon 's or barnes and noble 's online stores on any of these topics and you will be presented with a cornucopia of choices - there is not quite the neglect that nash claimed in these fields . to be sure , there will still be authors who write biographies on the `` great men '' of the american revolution , but there are many who also explore the social history of the conflict . thus , nash is not the lone voice for these `` forgotten '' as he claimed"}], "florentino": [{"num": 519, "context": "the best of marquez one of my favorite books . i read this again a couple of months ago . florentino ariza 's 50 year unrequited love for the haughty fermina daza is an amazing allegory of human love . when fermina marries another man , florentino does n't ever give up . doggedly he spends his life planning for their eventual getting together . in a way he is a ridiculous don quixote , undaunted by reality , pining over a lost cause . somehow this bizarre little man hopes on . no , he does n't hope . he insists . he becomes president of the local shipping company , he redecorates his childhood home with his love in mind , his love of the arts mirrors his love for her . why does this work ? marquez is just a genius . he simply lets the characters tell their story and he writes down their words . and so they come to life"}], "fermina": [{"num": 519, "context": "the best of marquez one of my favorite books . i read this again a couple of months ago . florentino ariza 's 50 year unrequited love for the haughty fermina daza is an amazing allegory of human love . when fermina marries another man , florentino does n't ever give up . doggedly he spends his life planning for their eventual getting together . in a way he is a ridiculous don quixote , undaunted by reality , pining over a lost cause . somehow this bizarre little man hopes on . no , he does n't hope . he insists . he becomes president of the local shipping company , he redecorates his childhood home with his love in mind , his love of the arts mirrors his love for her . why does this work ? marquez is just a genius . he simply lets the characters tell their story and he writes down their words . and so they come to life"}], "howes": [{"num": 524, "context": "mad man across the water high seas adventure with one of the most psychopath captains to command a ship . while it is a well known fact that many captains , especially those of whaling ships , were rigid , callous and at times barbaric in their conduct , howes norris was in the upper echelon of this deranged behavioral class . whether it was horrific floggings , withholding food , or senseless other malicious acts of torment , some may say that norris got what was coming to him . joan druett attempts to unfold the mystery of norris ' murder through two journals that were shrouded in secrecy for over 150 years . it is a good , entertaining read . for this reader though , the evidence is still inconclusive as to who was really responsible for norris ' death . all indications are that the two slain natives were held accountable but who was really the instigator ?"}, {"num": 525, "context": "sadist on the high seas joan druett adds her name to the growing list of authors who have , in the last few years , tackled the topic of seafaring misadventure . we have had several excellent entries in this genre , including nathaniel philbrick 's `` in the heart of the sea '' and mike dash 's `` batavia 's graveyard .
